@deftypefn  {} {} daspk_options ()
@deftypefnx {} {val =} daspk_options (@var{opt})
@deftypefnx {} {} daspk_options (@var{opt}, @var{val})
Query or set options for the function @code{daspk}.

When called with no arguments, the names of all available options and
their current values are displayed.

Given one argument, return the value of the option @var{opt}.

When called with two arguments, @code{daspk_options} sets the option
@var{opt} to value @var{val}.

Options include

@table @asis
@item @qcode{"absolute tolerance"}
Absolute tolerance.  May be either vector or scalar.  If a vector, it
must match the dimension of the state vector, and the relative
tolerance must also be a vector of the same length.

@item @qcode{"relative tolerance"}
Relative tolerance.  May be either vector or scalar.  If a vector, it
must match the dimension of the state vector, and the absolute
tolerance must also be a vector of the same length.

The local error test applied at each integration step is

@example
@group
  abs (local error in x(i))
       <= rtol(i) * abs (Y(i)) + atol(i)
@end group
@end example

@item @qcode{"compute consistent initial condition"}
Denoting the differential variables in the state vector by @samp{Y_d}
and the algebraic variables by @samp{Y_a}, @code{ddaspk} can solve
one of two initialization problems:

@enumerate
@item Given Y_d, calculate Y_a and Y'_d

@item Given Y', calculate Y.
@end enumerate

In either case, initial values for the given components are input, and
initial guesses for the unknown components must also be provided as
input.  Set this option to 1 to solve the first problem, or 2 to solve
the second (the default is 0, so you must provide a set of
initial conditions that are consistent).

If this option is set to a nonzero value, you must also set the
@qcode{"algebraic variables"} option to declare which variables in the
problem are algebraic.

@item @qcode{"use initial condition heuristics"}
Set to a nonzero value to use the initial condition heuristics options
described below.

@item @qcode{"initial condition heuristics"}
A vector of the following parameters that can be used to control the
initial condition calculation.

@table @code
@item MXNIT
Maximum number of Newton iterations (default is 5).

@item MXNJ
Maximum number of Jacobian evaluations (default is 6).

@item MXNH
Maximum number of values of the artificial stepsize parameter to be
tried if the @qcode{"compute consistent initial condition"} option has
been set to 1 (default is 5).

Note that the maximum total number of Newton iterations allowed is
@code{MXNIT*MXNJ*MXNH} if the @qcode{"compute consistent initial
condition"} option has been set to 1 and @code{MXNIT*MXNJ} if it is
set to 2.

@item LSOFF
Set to a nonzero value to disable the linesearch algorithm (default is
0).

@item STPTOL
Minimum scaled step in linesearch algorithm (default is eps^(2/3)).

@item EPINIT
Swing factor in the Newton iteration convergence test.  The test is
applied to the residual vector, premultiplied by the approximate
Jacobian.  For convergence, the weighted RMS norm of this vector
(scaled by the error weights) must be less than @code{EPINIT*EPCON},
where @code{EPCON} = 0.33 is the analogous test constant used in the
time steps.  The default is @code{EPINIT} = 0.01.
@end table

@item @qcode{"print initial condition info"}
Set this option to a nonzero value to display detailed information
about the initial condition calculation (default is 0).

@item @qcode{"exclude algebraic variables from error test"}
Set to a nonzero value to exclude algebraic variables from the error
test.  You must also set the @qcode{"algebraic variables"} option to
declare which variables in the problem are algebraic (default is 0).

@item @qcode{"algebraic variables"}
A vector of the same length as the state vector.  A nonzero element
indicates that the corresponding element of the state vector is an
algebraic variable (i.e., its derivative does not appear explicitly
in the equation set).

This option is required by the
@qcode{"compute consistent initial condition"} and
@qcode{"exclude algebraic variables from error test"} options.

@item @qcode{"enforce inequality constraints"}
Set to one of the following values to enforce the inequality
constraints specified by the @qcode{"inequality constraint types"}
option (default is 0).

@enumerate
@item To have constraint checking only in the initial condition calculation.

@item To enforce constraint checking during the integration.

@item To enforce both options 1 and 2.
@end enumerate

@item @qcode{"inequality constraint types"}
A vector of the same length as the state specifying the type of
inequality constraint.  Each element of the vector corresponds to an
element of the state and should be assigned one of the following
codes

@table @asis
@item -2
Less than zero.

@item -1
Less than or equal to zero.

@item 0
Not constrained.

@item 1
Greater than or equal to zero.

@item 2
Greater than zero.
@end table

This option only has an effect if the
@qcode{"enforce inequality constraints"} option is nonzero.

@item @qcode{"initial step size"}
Differential-algebraic problems may occasionally suffer from severe
scaling difficulties on the first step.  If you know a great deal
about the scaling of your problem, you can help to alleviate this
problem by specifying an initial stepsize (default is computed
automatically).

@item @qcode{"maximum order"}
Restrict the maximum order of the solution method.  This option must
be between 1 and 5, inclusive (default is 5).

@item @qcode{"maximum step size"}
Setting the maximum stepsize will avoid passing over very large
regions (default is not specified).

@item @qcode{"compute consistent initial condition"}
If nonzero, @code{dassl} will attempt to compute a consistent set of initial
conditions.  This is generally not reliable, so it is best to provide
a consistent set and leave this option set to zero.

@item @qcode{"enforce nonnegativity constraints"}
If you know that the solutions to your equations will always be
non-negative, it may help to set this parameter to a nonzero
value.  However, it is probably best to try leaving this option set to

If called with a single argument, the arguments of the generated function
are extracted from the function itself.  The generated function arguments
will then be in alphabetical order.  It should be noted that i and j are
ignored as arguments due to the ambiguity between their use as a variable or
their use as an built-in constant.  All arguments followed by a parenthesis
are considered to be functions.  If no arguments are found, a function
taking a single argument named @code{x} will be created.

If the second and subsequent arguments are character strings, they are the
names of the arguments of the function.

If the second argument is an integer @var{n}, the arguments are
@qcode{"x"}, @qcode{"P1"}, @dots{}, @qcode{"P@var{N}"}.

Programming Note: The use of @code{inline} is discouraged and it may be
removed from a future version of Octave.  The preferred way to create
functions from strings is through the use of anonymous functions

@deftypefnx {} {@var{s} =} struct (@var{obj})

Create a scalar or array structure and initialize its values.

The @var{field1}, @var{field2}, @dots{} variables are strings specifying the
names of the fields and the @var{value1}, @var{value2}, @dots{} variables
can be of any type.

If the values are cell arrays, create a structure array and initialize its
values.  The dimensions of each cell array of values must match.  Singleton
cells and non-cell values are repeated so that they fill the entire array.
If the cells are empty, create an empty structure array with the specified
field names.

If the argument is an object, return the underlying struct.

Observe that the syntax is optimized for struct @strong{arrays}.  Consider
the following examples:

@example
@group
struct ("foo", 1)
  @result{} scalar structure containing the fields:
    foo =  1

struct ("foo", @{@})
  @result{} 0x0 struct array containing the fields:
    foo

struct ("foo", @{ @{@} @})
  @result{} scalar structure containing the fields:
    foo = @{@}(0x0)

struct ("foo", @{1, 2, 3@})
  @result{} 1x3 struct array containing the fields:
    foo

@end group
@end example

@noindent
The first case is an ordinary scalar struct---one field, one value.  The
second produces an empty struct array with one field and no values, since
being passed an empty cell array of struct array values.  When the value is
a cell array containing a single entry, this becomes a scalar struct with
that single entry as the value of the field.  That single entry happens
to be an empty cell array.

Finally, if the value is a non-scalar cell array, then @code{struct}
produces a struct @strong{array}.

Balance the matrix @var{A} to reduce numerical errors in future
calculations.

Compute @code{@var{AA} = @var{DD} \ @var{A} * @var{DD}} in which @var{AA}
is a matrix whose row and column norms are roughly equal in magnitude, and
@code{@var{DD} = @var{P} * @var{D}}, in which @var{P} is a permutation
matrix and @var{D} is a diagonal matrix of powers of two.  This allows the
equilibration to be computed without round-off.  Results of eigenvalue
calculation are typically improved by balancing first.

If two output values are requested, @code{balance} returns
the diagonal @var{D} and the permutation @var{P} separately as vectors.
In this case, @code{@var{DD} = eye(n)(:,@var{P}) * diag (@var{D})}, where
@math{n} is the matrix size.

If four output values are requested, compute @code{@var{AA} =
@var{CC}*@var{A}*@var{DD}} and @code{@var{BB} = @var{CC}*@var{B}*@var{DD}},
in which @var{AA} and @var{BB} have nonzero elements of approximately the
same magnitude and @var{CC} and @var{DD} are permuted diagonal matrices as
in @var{DD} for the algebraic eigenvalue problem.

The eigenvalue balancing option @var{opt} may be one of:

@table @asis
@item @qcode{"noperm"}, @qcode{"S"}
Scale only; do not permute.

@item @qcode{"noscal"}, @qcode{"P"}

Return 1 for elements of @var{class}.
@end table

Additionally, @code{cellfun} accepts an arbitrary function @var{func}
in the form of an inline function, function handle, or the name of a
function (in a character string).  The function can take one or more
arguments, with the inputs arguments given by @var{C}, @var{D}, etc.
Equally the function can return one or more output arguments.  For example:

@example
@group
cellfun ("atan2", @{1, 0@}, @{0, 1@})
     @result{} [ 1.57080   0.00000 ]
@end group
@end example

The number of output arguments of @code{cellfun} matches the number of
output arguments of the function.  The outputs of the function will be
collected into the output arguments of @code{cellfun} like this:

@example
@group
function [a, b] = twoouts (x)
  a = x;
  b = x*x;
endfunction
[aa, bb] = cellfun (@@twoouts, @{1, 2, 3@})
     @result{}
        aa =
           1 2 3
        bb =
           1 4 9
@end group
@end example

Note that per default the output argument(s) are arrays of the same size as
the input arguments.  Input arguments that are singleton (1x1) cells will be
automatically expanded to the size of the other arguments.

If the parameter @qcode{"UniformOutput"} is set to true (the default),
then the function must return scalars which will be concatenated into the
return array(s).  If @qcode{"UniformOutput"} is false, the outputs are
concatenated into a cell array (or cell arrays).  For example:

@example
@group
cellfun ("tolower", @{"Foo", "Bar", "FooBar"@},
         "UniformOutput", false)
@result{} @{"foo", "bar", "foobar"@}
@end group
@end example

Given the parameter @qcode{"ErrorHandler"}, then @var{errfunc} defines a
function to call in case @var{func} generates an error.  The form of the
function is

@example
function [@dots{}] = errfunc (@var{s}, @dots{})
@end example

@noindent
where there is an additional input argument to @var{errfunc} relative to
@var{func}, given by @var{s}.  This is a structure with the elements
@qcode{"identifier"}, @qcode{"message"}, and @qcode{"index"} giving
respectively the error identifier, the error message, and the index into the
input arguments of the element that caused the error.  For example:

@example
@group
function y = foo (s, x), y = NaN; endfunction
cellfun ("factorial", @{-1,2@}, "ErrorHandler", @@foo)
@result{} [NaN 2]
@end group
@end example

Use @code{cellfun} intelligently.  The @code{cellfun} function is a
useful tool for avoiding loops.  It is often used with anonymous
function handles; however, calling an anonymous function involves an
overhead quite comparable to the overhead of an m-file function.
Passing a handle to a built-in function is faster, because the
interpreter is not involved in the internal loop.  For example:

@example
@group
a = @{@dots{}@}
v = cellfun (@@(x) det (x), a); # compute determinants
v = cellfun (@@det, a); # faster
@end group
@end example

Execute a function on each element of an array.

This is useful for functions that do not accept array arguments.  If the
function does accept array arguments it is better to call the function
directly.

The first input argument @var{func} can be a string, a function
handle, an inline function, or an anonymous function.  The input
argument @var{A} can be a logic array, a numeric array, a string
array, a structure array, or a cell array.  By a call of the function
@code{arrayfun} all elements of @var{A} are passed on to the named
function @var{func} individually.

The named function can also take more than two input arguments, with
the input arguments given as third input argument @var{b}, fourth
input argument @var{c}, @dots{}  If given more than one array input
argument then all input arguments must have the same sizes, for
example:

@example
@group
arrayfun (@@atan2, [1, 0], [0, 1])
     @result{} [ 1.57080   0.00000 ]
@end group
@end example

If the parameter @var{val} after a further string input argument
@qcode{"UniformOutput"} is set @code{true} (the default), then the named
function @var{func} must return a single element which then will be
concatenated into the return value and is of type matrix.  Otherwise,
if that parameter is set to @code{false}, then the outputs are
concatenated in a cell array.  For example:

@example
@group
arrayfun (@@(x,y) x:y, "abc", "def", "UniformOutput", false)
@result{}
   @{
     [1,1] = abcd
     [1,2] = bcde
     [1,3] = cdef
   @}
@end group
@end example

If more than one output arguments are given then the named function
must return the number of return values that also are expected, for
example:

@example
@group
[A, B, C] = arrayfun (@@find, [10; 0], "UniformOutput", false)
@result{}
A =
@{
   [1,1] =  1
   [2,1] = [](0x0)
@}
B =
@{
   [1,1] =  1
   [2,1] = [](0x0)
@}
C =
@{
   [1,1] =  10
   [2,1] = [](0x0)
@}
@end group
@end example

If the parameter @var{errfunc} after a further string input argument
@qcode{"ErrorHandler"} is another string, a function handle, an inline
function, or an anonymous function, then @var{errfunc} defines a
function to call in the case that @var{func} generates an error.
The definition of the function must be of the form

@example
function [@dots{}] = errfunc (@var{s}, @dots{})
@end example

@noindent
where there is an additional input argument to @var{errfunc}
relative to @var{func}, given by @var{s}.  This is a structure with
the elements @qcode{"identifier"}, @qcode{"message"}, and
@qcode{"index"} giving, respectively, the error identifier, the error
message, and the index of the array elements that caused the error.  The
size of the output argument of @var{errfunc} must have the same size as the
output argument of @var{func}, otherwise a real error is thrown.  For
example:

@example
@group
function y = ferr (s, x), y = "MyString"; endfunction
arrayfun (@@str2num, [1234],
          "UniformOutput", false, "ErrorHandler", @@ferr)

If @var{A} is 2-D, then it is required that

multi-dimensional and the number of dimensional arguments is equal to the
dimensions of @var{A}, then it is required that
@code{sum (@var{di}) == size (@var{A}, i)}.

Given a single dimensional argument @var{r}, the other dimensional

row of the output @var{x} is @var{x_0} and the first row
of the output @var{xdot} is @var{xdot_0}.

The first argument, @var{fcn}, is a string, inline, or function handle

residuals for the set of equations.  It must have the form

the function @math{f} described above, and the second element names a

The second and third arguments to @code{daspk} specify the initial
condition of the states and their derivatives, and the fourth argument
specifies a vector of output times at which the solution is desired,
including the time corresponding to the initial condition.

The set of initial states and derivatives are not strictly required to
be consistent.  If they are not consistent, you must use the
@code{daspk_options} function to provide additional information so
that @code{daspk} can compute a consistent starting point.

The fifth argument is optional, and may be used to specify a set of
times that the DAE solver should not integrate past.  It is useful for
avoiding difficulties with singularities and points where there is a
discontinuity in the derivative.

After a successful computation, the value of @var{istate} will be
greater than zero (consistent with the Fortran version of @sc{daspk}).

If the computation is not successful, the value of @var{istate} will be
less than zero and @var{msg} will contain additional information.

You can use the function @code{daspk_options} to set optional
parameters for @code{daspk}.

If @var{fcn} is a two-element string array or a two-element cell array
of strings, inline functions, or function handles, the first element names
the function @math{f} described above, and the second element names a
function to compute the modified Jacobian

@tex

@example
@group
      df       df

The modified Jacobian function must have the form

@example
@group

@var{jac} = j (@var{x}, @var{xdot}, @var{t}, @var{c})

@end group
@end example

The optional second argument names a function that defines the
constraint functions whose roots are desired during the integration.
This function must have the form

@example
@var{g_out} = g (@var{x}, @var{t})
@end example

@noindent
and return a vector of the constraint function values.
If the value of any of the constraint functions changes sign, @sc{dasrt}
will attempt to stop the integration at the point of the sign change.

If the name of the constraint function is omitted, @code{dasrt} solves
the same problem as @code{daspk} or @code{dassl}.

Note that because of numerical errors in the constraint functions
due to round-off and integration error, @sc{dasrt} may return false
roots, or return the same root at two or more nearly equal values of
@var{T}.  If such false roots are suspected, the user should consider
smaller error tolerances or higher precision in the evaluation of the
constraint functions.

If a root of some constraint function defines the end of the problem,
the input to @sc{dasrt} should nevertheless allow integration to a
point slightly past that root, so that @sc{dasrt} can locate the root
by interpolation.

The third and fourth arguments to @code{dasrt} specify the initial
condition of the states and their derivatives, and the fourth argument
specifies a vector of output times at which the solution is desired,
including the time corresponding to the initial condition.

The set of initial states and derivatives are not strictly required to
be consistent.  In practice, however, @sc{dassl} is not very good at
determining a consistent set for you, so it is best if you ensure that
the initial values result in the function evaluating to zero.

The sixth argument is optional, and may be used to specify a set of
times that the DAE solver should not integrate past.  It is useful for
avoiding difficulties with singularities and points where there is a
discontinuity in the derivative.

After a successful computation, the value of @var{istate} will be
greater than zero (consistent with the Fortran version of @sc{dassl}).

If the computation is not successful, the value of @var{istate} will be
less than zero and @var{msg} will contain additional information.

You can use the function @code{dasrt_options} to set optional
parameters for @code{dasrt}.

@deftypefnx {} {} sum (@dots{}, "native")
@deftypefnx {} {} sum (@dots{}, "double")
@deftypefnx {} {} sum (@dots{}, "extra")
Sum of elements along dimension @var{dim}.

If @var{dim} is omitted, it defaults to the first non-singleton dimension.

The optional @qcode{"type"} input determines the class of the variable
used for calculations.  If the argument @qcode{"native"} is given, then
the operation is performed in the same type as the original argument, rather
than the default double type.

For example:

@example
@group
sum ([true, true])
   @result{} 2
sum ([true, true], "native")
   @result{} true
@end group
@end example

On the contrary, if @qcode{"double"} is given, the sum is performed in
double precision even for single precision inputs.

For double precision inputs, the @qcode{"extra"} option will use a more
accurate algorithm than straightforward summation.  For single precision
inputs, @qcode{"extra"} is the same as @qcode{"double"}.  Otherwise,
@qcode{"extra"} has no effect.

Resize @var{x} cutting off elements as necessary.

In the result, element with certain indices is equal to the corresponding

otherwise, the element is set to zero.

In other words, the statement

@example
@group
y = zeros (dv, class (x));
sz = min (dv, size (x));
for i = 1:length (sz)
  idx@{i@} = 1:sz(i);
endfor
y(idx@{:@}) = x(idx@{:@});

@noindent
but is performed more efficiently.

If only @var{m} is supplied, and it is a scalar, the dimension of the
result is @var{m}-by-@var{m}.
If @var{m}, @var{n}, @dots{} are all scalars, then the dimensions of
the result are @var{m}-by-@var{n}-by-@dots{}.
If given a vector as input, then the
dimensions of the result are given by the elements of that vector.

An object can be resized to more dimensions than it has;
in such case the missing dimensions are assumed to be 1.
Resizing an object to fewer dimensions is not possible.

Set or check a wall-clock timer.

Calling @code{tic} without an output argument sets the internal timer state.
Subsequent calls to @code{toc} return the number of seconds since the timer
was set.
For example,

@example
@group
tic ();
# many computations later@dots{}
elapsed_time = toc ();
@end group
@end example

@noindent
will set the variable @code{elapsed_time} to the number of seconds since
the most recent call to the function @code{tic}.

If called with one output argument, @code{tic} returns a scalar
of type @code{uint64} that may be later passed to @code{toc}.

@example
@group
id = tic; pause (5); toc (id)
      @result{} 5.0010
@end group
@end example

Calling @code{tic} and @code{toc} this way allows nested timing calls.

If you are more interested in the CPU time that your process used, you
should use the @code{cputime} function instead.  The @code{tic} and
@code{toc} functions report the actual wall clock time that elapsed
between the calls.  This may include time spent processing other jobs or

If your system does not have a way to report CPU time usage, @code{cputime}
returns 0 for each of its output values.

@deftypefnx {} {[@var{s}, @var{i}] =} sort (@var{x}, @var{dim}, @var{mode})
Return a copy of @var{x} with the elements arranged in increasing order.

For matrices, @code{sort} orders the elements within columns

For example:

@example
@group
sort ([1, 2; 2, 3; 3, 1])
   @result{}  1  1
       2  2
       3  3
@end group
@end example

If the optional argument @var{dim} is given, then the matrix is sorted
along the dimension defined by @var{dim}.  The optional argument @code{mode}
defines the order in which the values will be sorted.  Valid values of
@code{mode} are @qcode{"ascend"} or @qcode{"descend"}.

The @code{sort} function may also be used to produce a matrix
containing the original row indices of the elements in the sorted
matrix.  For example:

@example
@group
[s, i] = sort ([1, 2; 2, 3; 3, 1])
  @result{} s = 1  1
         2  2
         3  3
  @result{} i = 1  3
         2  1
         3  2
@end group
@end example

For equal elements, the indices are such that equal elements are listed
in the order in which they appeared in the original list.

Sorting of complex entries is done first by magnitude
(@w{@code{abs (@var{z})}}) and for any ties by phase angle
(@w{@code{angle (z)}}).  For example:

@example
@group
sort ([1+i; 1; 1-i])
    @result{} 1 + 0i
       1 - 1i
       1 + 1i
@end group
@end example

NaN values are treated as being greater than any other value and are sorted
to the end of the list.

The @code{sort} function may also be used to sort strings and cell arrays
of strings, in which case ASCII dictionary order (uppercase 'A' precedes
lowercase 'a') of the strings is used.

The algorithm used in @code{sort} is optimized for the sorting of partially
ordered lists.

By default,  @var{mode} is @qcode{"ascending"}.  NaNs are treated in the

Select the n-th smallest element of a vector, using the ordering defined by
@code{sort}.

The result is equivalent to @code{sort(@var{x})(@var{n})}.

@var{n} can also be a contiguous range, either ascending @code{l:u}
or descending @code{u:-1:l}, in which case a range of elements is returned.

If @var{x} is an array, @code{nth_element} operates along the dimension
defined by @var{dim}, or the first non-singleton dimension if @var{dim} is
not given.

Programming Note: nth_element encapsulates the C++ standard library
algorithms nth_element and partial_sort.  On average, the complexity of the
operation is O(M*log(K)), where @w{@code{M = size (@var{x}, @var{dim})}} and
@w{@code{K = length (@var{n})}}.  This function is intended for cases where

Set breakpoints for the built-in debugger.

@var{func} is the name of a function on the current @code{path}.  When
already in debug mode the @var{func} argument can be omitted and the current
function will be used.  Breakpoints at subfunctions are set with the scope
operator @samp{>}.  For example, If @file{file.m} has a subfunction
@code{func2}, then a breakpoint in @code{func2} can be specified by
@code{file>func2}.

@var{line} is the line number at which to break.  If @var{line} is not
specified, it defaults to the first executable line in the file
@file{func.m}.  Multiple lines can be specified in a single command; when
function syntax is used, the lines may also be passed as a single vector
argument (@code{[@var{line1}, @var{line2}, @dots{}]}).

@var{condition} is any Octave expression that can be evaluated in the code
context that exists at the breakpoint.  When the breakpoint is encountered,
@var{condition} will be evaluated, and execution will stop if
@var{condition} is true.  If @var{condition} cannot be evaluated, for
example because it refers to an undefined variable, an error will be thrown.
 Expressions with side effects (such as @code{y++ > 1}) will alter
variables, and should generally be avoided.  Conditions containing quotes
(@samp{"}, @samp{'}) or comment characters (@samp{#}, @samp{%}) must be
enclosed in quotes.  (This does not apply to conditions entered from the
editor's context menu.)  For example:

@example
dbstop in strread at 209 if 'any (format == "%f")'
@end example

The form specifying @var{event} does not cause a specific breakpoint at a
given function and line number.  Instead it causes debug mode to be entered
when certain unexpected events are encountered.  Possible values are

@table @code
@item error
Stop when an error is reported.  This is equivalent to specifying
both @code{debug_on_error (true)} and @code{debug_on_interrupt (true)}.

@item caught error
Stop when an error is caught by a try-catch block (not yet implemented).

@item interrupt
Stop when an interrupt (@kbd{Ctrl-C}) occurs.

@item naninf
Stop when code returns a non-finite value (not yet implemented).

@item warning
Stop when a warning is reported.  This is equivalent to specifying
@code{debug_on_warning (true)}.
@end table

The events @code{error}, @code{caught error}, and @code{warning} can all be
followed by a string specifying an error ID or warning ID@.  If that is
done, only errors with the specified ID will cause execution to stop.  To
stop on one of a set of IDs, multiple @code{dbstop} commands must be
issued.

Breakpoints and events can be removed using the @code{dbclear} command with
the same syntax.

It is possible to save all breakpoints and restore them at once by issuing
the commands @code{bp_state = dbstatus; @dots{}; dbstop (bp_state)}.

The optional output @var{rline} is the real line number where the breakpoint
was set.  This can differ from the specified line if the line is not
executable.  For example, if a breakpoint attempted on a blank line then
Octave will set the real breakpoint at the next executable line.

When a file is re-parsed, such as when it is modified outside the GUI,
all breakpoints within the file are cleared.

Arguments are

@table @var
@item func
Function name as a string variable.  When already in debug mode this

@item line
Line number from which to remove a breakpoint.  Multiple lines may be given
as separate arguments or as a vector.

@item event
An event such as @code{error}, @code{interrupt}, or @code{warning}
(@pxref{XREFdbstop,,dbstop} for details).

If a function name @var{func} is specified then only report breakpoints
for the named function and its subfunctions.

The optional return argument @var{bp_list} is a struct array with the
following fields.

@table @asis
@item name
The name of the function with a breakpoint.  A subfunction, say @code{func2}
within an m-file, say @file{file.m}, is specified as @code{file>func2}.

@item file
The name of the m-file where the function code is located.

@item line
The line number with the breakpoint.

@item cond
The condition that must be satisfied for the breakpoint to be active, or
the empty string for unconditional breakpoints.
@end table

@c Note: When @code{dbstatus} is called from the debug prompt within a function,
@c the list of breakpoints is automatically trimmed to the breakpoints in the
@c current function.
If @code{dbstop if error} is true but no explicit IDs are specified, the
return value will have an empty field called @qcode{"errs"}.  If IDs are
specified, the @code{errs} field will have one row per ID@.  If
@code{dbstop if error} is false, there is no @qcode{"errs"} field.

@deftypefnx {} {@var{data} =} dlmread (@dots{}, "emptyvalue", @var{EMPTYVAL})
Read numeric data from the text file @var{file} which uses the delimiter
@var{sep} between data values.

If @var{sep} is not defined the separator between fields is determined from
the file itself.

The optional scalar arguments @var{r0} and @var{c0} define the starting row
and column of the data to be read.  These values are indexed from zero,
i.e., the first data row corresponds to an index of zero.

The @var{range} parameter specifies exactly which data elements are read.
The first form of the parameter is a 4-element vector containing the upper
left and lower right corners @code{[@var{R0},@var{C0},@var{R1},@var{C1}]}
where the indices are zero-based.  Alternatively, a spreadsheet style
form such as @qcode{"A2..Q15"} or @qcode{"T1:AA5"} can be used.  The
lowest alphabetical index @qcode{'A'} refers to the first column.  The
lowest row index is 1.

@var{file} should be a filename or a file id given by @code{fopen}.  In the
latter case, the file is read until end of file is reached.

The @qcode{"emptyvalue"} option may be used to specify the value used to
fill empty fields.  The default is zero.  Note that any non-numeric values,
such as text, are also replaced by the @qcode{"emptyvalue"}.

Reissue a previous error as defined by @var{err}.

@var{err} is a structure that must contain at least the @qcode{"message"}

@qcode{"stack"} that gives information on the assumed location of the

@c error libinterp/corefcn/error.cc
-*- texinfo -*-
@deftypefn  {} {} error (@var{template}, @dots{})
@deftypefnx {} {} error (@var{id}, @var{template}, @dots{})
Display an error message and stop m-file execution.

Format the optional arguments under the control of the template string
@var{template} using the same rules as the @code{printf} family of
functions (@pxref{Formatted Output}) and print the resulting message
on the @code{stderr} stream.  The message is prefixed by the character
string @samp{error: }.

Calling @code{error} also sets Octave's internal error state such that
control will return to the top level without evaluating any further
commands.  This is useful for aborting from functions or scripts.

If the error message does not end with a newline character, Octave will
print a traceback of all the function calls leading to the error.  For
example, given the following function definitions:

@example
@group
function f () g (); end
function g () h (); end
function h () nargin == 1 || error ("nargin != 1"); end
@end group
@end example

@noindent
calling the function @code{f} will result in a list of messages that
can help you to quickly find the exact location of the error:

@example
@group
f ()
error: nargin != 1
error: called from:
error:   h at line 1, column 27
error:   g at line 1, column 15
error:   f at line 1, column 15
@end group
@end example

If the error message ends in a newline character, Octave will print the
message but will not display any traceback messages as it returns
control to the top level.  For example, modifying the error message
in the previous example to end in a newline causes Octave to only print
a single message:

@example
@group
function h () nargin == 1 || error ("nargin != 1\n"); end
f ()
error: nargin != 1
@end group
@end example

A null string ("") input to @code{error} will be ignored and the code
will continue running as if the statement were a NOP@.  This is for
compatibility with @sc{matlab}.  It also makes it possible to write code
such as

@example
@group
err_msg = "";
if (CONDITION 1)
  err_msg = "CONDITION 1 found";
elseif (CONDITION2)
  err_msg = "CONDITION 2 found";
@dots{}
endif
error (err_msg);
@end group
@end example

@noindent
which will only stop execution if an error has been found.

Implementation Note: For compatibility with @sc{matlab}, escape
sequences in @var{template} (e.g., @qcode{"@xbackslashchar{}n"} =>
newline) are processed regardless of whether @var{template} has been defined
with single quotes, as long as there are two or more input arguments.  To
disable escape sequence expansion use a second backslash before the sequence
(e.g., @qcode{"@xbackslashchar{}@xbackslashchar{}n"}) or use the
@code{regexptranslate} function.

@deftypefnx {} {} warning (@var{state}, "backtrace")
@deftypefnx {} {} warning (@var{state}, @var{id}, "local")
Display a warning message or control the behavior of Octave's warning
system.

Format the optional arguments under the control of the template string
@var{template} using the same rules as the @code{printf} family of
functions (@pxref{Formatted Output}) and print the resulting message
on the @code{stderr} stream.  The message is prefixed by the character
string @samp{warning: }.
You should use this function when you want to notify the user
of an unusual condition, but only when it makes sense for your program
to go on.

The optional message identifier allows users to enable or disable
warnings tagged by @var{id}.  A message identifier is of the form
"NAMESPACE:WARNING-NAME".  Octave's own warnings use the
@qcode{"Octave"} namespace (@pxref{XREFwarning_ids,,warning_ids}).  The special
identifier @qcode{"all"} may be used to set the state of all warnings.

If the first argument is @qcode{"on"} or @qcode{"off"},
set the state of a particular warning using the identifier @var{id}.  If the
first argument is @qcode{"query"}, query the state of this warning
instead.  If the identifier is omitted, a value of @qcode{"all"} is
assumed.  If you set the state of a warning to @qcode{"error"}, the
warning named by @var{id} is handled as if it were an error instead.  So,
for example, the following handles all warnings as errors:

@example
@group
warning ("error");
@end group
@end example

If the state is @qcode{"on"} or @qcode{"off"} and the third argument
is @qcode{"backtrace"}, then a stack trace is printed along with the
warning message when warnings occur inside function calls.  This option
is enabled by default.

If the state is @qcode{"on"}, @qcode{"off"}, or @qcode{"error"}
and the third argument is @qcode{"local"}, then the warning state
will be set temporarily, until the end of the current function.
Changes to warning states that are set locally affect the current
function and all functions called from the current scope.  The
previous warning state is restored on return from the current
function.  The @qcode{"local"} option is ignored if used in the top-level
workspace.

Implementation Note: For compatibility with @sc{matlab}, escape
sequences in @var{template} (e.g., @qcode{"@xbackslashchar{}n"} =>
newline) are processed regardless of whether @var{template} has been defined
with single quotes, as long as there are two or more input arguments.  To
disable escape sequence expansion use a second backslash before the sequence
(e.g., @qcode{"@xbackslashchar{}@xbackslashchar{}n"}) or use the
@code{regexptranslate} function.

@deftypefnx {} {[@var{file}, @var{mode}, @var{arch}] =} fopen (@var{fid})
Open a file for low-level I/O or query open files and file descriptors.

The first form of the @code{fopen} function opens the named file with
the specified mode (read-write, read-only, etc.) and architecture
interpretation (IEEE big endian, IEEE little endian, etc.), and returns
an integer value that may be used to refer to the file later.  If an
error occurs, @var{fid} is set to @minus{}1 and @var{msg} contains the
corresponding system error message.  The @var{mode} is a one or two
character string that specifies whether the file is to be opened for
reading, writing, or both.

The second form of the @code{fopen} function returns a vector of file ids
corresponding to all the currently open files, excluding the
@code{stdin}, @code{stdout}, and @code{stderr} streams.

The third form of the @code{fopen} function returns information about the
open file given its file id.

For example,

@example
myfile = fopen ("splat.dat", "r", "ieee-le");
@end example

@noindent
opens the file @file{splat.dat} for reading.  If necessary, binary
numeric values will be read assuming they are stored in IEEE format with
the least significant bit first, and then converted to the native
representation.

Opening a file that is already open simply opens it again and returns a
separate file id.  It is not an error to open a file several times,
though writing to the same file through several different file ids may
produce unexpected results.

The possible values of @var{mode} are

@table @asis
@item @samp{r} (default)
Open a file for reading.

@item @samp{w}
Open a file for writing.  The previous contents are discarded.

@item @samp{a}
Open or create a file for writing at the end of the file.

@item @samp{r+}
Open an existing file for reading and writing.

@item @samp{w+}
Open a file for reading or writing.  The previous contents are
discarded.

@item @samp{a+}
Open or create a file for reading or writing at the end of the
file.
@end table

Append a @qcode{"t"} to the mode string to open the file in text mode or a
@qcode{"b"} to open in binary mode.  On Windows systems,
text mode reading and writing automatically converts linefeeds to the
appropriate line end character for the system (carriage-return linefeed on
Windows).  The default when no mode is specified is binary.

Additionally, you may append a @qcode{"z"} to the mode string to open a
gzipped file for reading or writing.  For this to be successful, you
must also open the file in binary mode.

The parameter @var{arch} is a string specifying the default data format
for the file.  Valid values for @var{arch} are:

@table @asis
@item @qcode{"native"} or @qcode{"n"} (default)
The format of the current machine.

@item @qcode{"ieee-be"} or @qcode{"b"}
IEEE big endian format.

@item @qcode{"ieee-le"} or @qcode{"l"}
IEEE little endian format.
@end table

@noindent
However, conversions are currently only supported for @samp{native},
@samp{ieee-be}, and @samp{ieee-le} formats.

When opening a new file that does not yet exist, permissions will be set to
@code{0666 - @var{umask}}.

Compatibility Note: Octave opens files using buffered I/O.  Small writes are
accumulated until an internal buffer is filled, and then everything is written
in a single operation.  This is very efficient and improves performance.
@sc{matlab}, however, opens files using flushed I/O where every write operation
is immediately performed.  If the write operation must be performed immediately
after data has been written then the write should be followed by a call to
@code{fflush} to flush the internal buffer.

Read data from a text file or string.

The string @var{str} or file associated with @var{fid} is read from and
parsed according to @var{format}.  The function is an extension of
@code{strread} and @code{textread}.  Differences include: the ability to
read from either a file or a string, additional options, and additional
format specifiers.

The input is interpreted as a sequence of words, delimiters (such as
whitespace), and literals.  The characters that form delimiters and
whitespace are determined by the options.  The format consists of format
specifiers interspersed between literals.  In the format, whitespace forms
a delimiter between consecutive literals, but is otherwise ignored.

The output @var{C} is a cell array where the number of columns is determined
by the number of format specifiers.

The first word of the input is matched to the first specifier of the format
and placed in the first column of the output; the second is matched to the
second specifier and placed in the second column and so forth.  If there
are more words than specifiers then the process is repeated until all words
have been processed or the limit imposed by @var{repeat} has been met (see
below).

The string @var{format} describes how the words in @var{str} should be
parsed.  As in @var{fscanf}, any (non-whitespace) text in the format that is
not one of these specifiers is considered a literal.  If there is a literal
between two format specifiers then that same literal must appear in the
input stream between the matching words.

The following specifiers are valid:

@table @code
@item  %f
@itemx %f64
@itemx %n
The word is parsed as a number and converted to double.

@item  %f32
The word is parsed as a number and converted to single (float).

@item  %d
@itemx %d8
@itemx %d16
@itemx %d32
@itemx %d64
The word is parsed as a number and converted to int8, int16, int32, or
int64.  If no size is specified then int32 is used.

@item  %u
@itemx %u8
@itemx %u16
@itemx %u32
@itemx %u64
The word is parsed as a number and converted to uint8, uint16, uint32, or
uint64.  If no size is specified then uint32 is used.

@item %s
The word is parsed as a string ending at the last character before
whitespace, an end-of-line, or a delimiter specified in the options.

@item %q
The word is parsed as a "quoted string".
If the first character of the string is a double quote (") then the string
includes everything until a matching double quote---including whitespace,
delimiters, and end-of-line characters.  If a pair of consecutive double
quotes appears in the input, it is replaced in the output by a single
double quote.  For examples, the input "He said ""Hello""" would
return the value 'He said "Hello"'.

@item  %c
The next character of the input is read.
This includes delimiters, whitespace, and end-of-line characters.

@item  %[@dots{}]
@itemx %[^@dots{}]
In the first form, the word consists of the longest run consisting of only
characters between the brackets.  Ranges of characters can be specified by
a hyphen; for example, %[0-9a-zA-Z] matches all alphanumeric characters (if
the underlying character set is ASCII).  Since @sc{matlab} treats hyphens
literally, this expansion only applies to alphanumeric characters.  To
include '-' in the set, it should appear first or last in the brackets; to
include ']', it should be the first character.  If the first character is
'^' then the word consists of characters @strong{not} listed.

@item %N@dots{}
For %s, %c %d, %f, %n, %u, an optional width can be specified as %Ns, etc.
where N is an integer > 1.  For %c, this causes exactly N characters to be
read instead of a single character.  For the other specifiers, it is an
upper bound on the number of characters read; normal delimiters can cause
fewer characters to be read.  For complex numbers, this limit applies to
the real and imaginary components individually.  For %f and %n, format
specifiers like %N.Mf are allowed, where M is an upper bound on number of
characters after the decimal point to be considered; subsequent digits are
skipped.  For example, the specifier %8.2f would read 12.345e6 as 1.234e7.

@item %*@dots{}
The word specified by the remainder of the conversion specifier is skipped.

@item literals
In addition the format may contain literal character strings; these will be
skipped during reading.  If the input string does not match this literal,
the processing terminates.
@end table

Parsed words corresponding to the first specifier are returned in the first
output argument and likewise for the rest of the specifiers.

By default, if there is only one input argument, @var{format} is @t{"%f"}.
This means that numbers are read from the input into a single column vector.
If @var{format} is explicitly empty (@qcode{""}) then textscan will
return data in a number of columns matching the number of fields on the
first data line of the input.  Either of these is suitable only when the
input is exclusively numeric.

For example, the string

@smallexample
@group
@var{str} = "\
Bunny Bugs   5.5\n\
Duck Daffy  -7.5e-5\n\
Penguin Tux   6"
@end group
@end smallexample

@noindent
can be read using

@example
@var{a} = textscan (@var{str}, "%s %s %f");
@end example

The optional numeric argument @var{repeat} can be used for limiting the
number of items read:

@table @asis
@item -1
Read all of the string or file until the end (default).

@item N
Read until the first of two conditions occurs: 1) the format has been
processed N times, or 2) N lines of the input have been processed.  Zero
(0) is an acceptable value for @var{repeat}.  Currently, end-of-line
characters inside %q, %c, and %[@dots{}]$ conversions do not contribute to
the line count.  This is incompatible with @sc{matlab} and may change in
future.
@end table

The behavior of @code{textscan} can be changed via property/value pairs.
The following properties are recognized:

@table @asis
@item @qcode{"BufSize"}
This specifies the number of bytes to use for the internal buffer.
A modest speed improvement may be obtained by setting this to a large value
when reading a large file, especially if the input contains long strings.
The default is 4096, or a value dependent on @var{n} if that is specified.

@item @qcode{"CollectOutput"}
A value of 1 or true instructs @code{textscan} to concatenate consecutive
columns of the same class in the output cell array.  A value of 0 or false
(default) leaves output in distinct columns.

@item @qcode{"CommentStyle"}
Specify parts of the input which are considered comments and will be
skipped.  @var{value} is the comment style and can be either (1) A string
or 1x1 cell string, to skip everything to the right of it; (2) A cell array
of two strings, to skip everything between the first and second strings.
Comments are only parsed where whitespace is accepted and do not act as
delimiters.

@item @qcode{"Delimiter"}
If @var{value} is a string, any character in @var{value} will be used to
split the input into words.  If @var{value} is a cell array of strings,
any string in the array will be used to split the input into words.
(default value = any whitespace.)

@item @qcode{"EmptyValue"}
Value to return for empty numeric values in non-whitespace delimited data.
The default is NaN@.  When the data type does not support NaN (int32 for
example), then the default is zero.

@item @qcode{"EndOfLine"}
@var{value} can be either an emtpy or one character specifying the
end-of-line character, or the pair
@qcode{"@xbackslashchar{}r@xbackslashchar{}n"} (CRLF).
In the latter case, any of
@qcode{"@xbackslashchar{}r"}, @qcode{"@xbackslashchar{}n"} or
@qcode{"@xbackslashchar{}r@xbackslashchar{}n"} is counted as a (single)
newline.  If no value is given,
@qcode{"@xbackslashchar{}r@xbackslashchar{}n"} is used.
@c If set to "" (empty string) EOLs are ignored as delimiters and added
@c to whitespace.

@c When reading from a character string, optional input argument @var{n}
@c specifies the number of times @var{format} should be used (i.e., to limit
@c the amount of data read).
@c When reading from file, @var{n} specifies the number of data lines to read;
@c in this sense it differs slightly from the format repeat count in strread.

@item @qcode{"HeaderLines"}
The first @var{value} number of lines of @var{fid} are skipped.  Note that
this does not refer to the first non-comment lines, but the first lines of
any type.

@item @qcode{"MultipleDelimsAsOne"}
If @var{value} is nonzero, treat a series of consecutive delimiters,
without whitespace in between, as a single delimiter.  Consecutive
delimiter series need not be vertically aligned.  Without this option, a
single delimiter before the end of the line does not cause the line to be
considered to end with an empty value, but a single delimiter at the start
of a line causes the line to be considered to start with an empty value.

@item @qcode{"TreatAsEmpty"}
Treat single occurrences (surrounded by delimiters or whitespace) of the
string(s) in @var{value} as missing values.

@item @qcode{"ReturnOnError"}
If set to numerical 1 or true, return normally as soon as an error is
encountered, such as trying to read a string using @code{%f}.
If set to 0 or false, return an error and no data.

@item @qcode{"Whitespace"}
Any character in @var{value} will be interpreted as whitespace and trimmed;
The default value for whitespace is
@c Note: the next line specifically has a newline which generates a space
@c       in the output of qcode, but keeps the next line < 80 characters.
@qcode{"
@xbackslashchar{}b@xbackslashchar{}r@xbackslashchar{}n@xbackslashchar{}t"}
(note the space).  Unless whitespace is set to @qcode{""} (empty) AND at
least one @qcode{"%s"} format conversion specifier is supplied, a space is
always part of whitespace.

@end table

When the number of words in @var{str} or @var{fid} doesn't match an exact
multiple of the number of format conversion specifiers, @code{textscan}'s
behavior depends on whether the last character of the string or file is an
end-of-line as specified by the @code{EndOfLine} option:

@table @asis
@item last character = end-of-line
Data columns are padded with empty fields, NaN or 0 (for integer fields) so
that all columns have equal length

@item last character is not end-of-line
Data columns are not padded; @code{textscan} returns columns of unequal
length
@end table

The second output @var{position} provides the location, in characters
from the beginning of the file or string, where processing stopped.

@end table

@noindent
The default precision is @qcode{"uchar"}.

The @var{precision} argument may also specify an optional repeat
count.  For example, @samp{32*single} causes @code{fread} to read
a block of 32 single precision floating point numbers.  Reading in
blocks is useful in combination with the @var{skip} argument.

The @var{precision} argument may also specify a type conversion.
For example, @samp{int16=>int32} causes @code{fread} to read 16-bit
integer values and return an array of 32-bit integer values.  By
default, @code{fread} returns a double precision array.  The special
form @samp{*TYPE} is shorthand for @samp{TYPE=>TYPE}.

The conversion and repeat counts may be combined.  For example, the
specification @samp{32*single=>single} causes @code{fread} to read
blocks of single precision floating point values and return an array
of single precision values instead of the default array of double
precision values.

The optional argument @var{skip} specifies the number of bytes to skip
after each element (or block of elements) is read.  If it is not
specified, a value of 0 is assumed.  If the final block read is not
complete, the final skip is omitted.  For example,

@example
fread (f, 10, "3*single=>single", 8)
@end example

@noindent
will omit the final 8-byte skip because the last read will not be
a complete block of 3 values.

The optional argument @var{arch} is a string specifying the data format
for the file.  Valid values are

@table @asis
@item @qcode{"native"} or @qcode{"n"}
The format of the current machine.

@item @qcode{"ieee-be"} or @qcode{"b"}
IEEE big endian.

@item @qcode{"ieee-le"} or @qcode{"l"}
IEEE little endian.
@end table

If no @var{arch} is given the value used in the call to @code{fopen} which
created the file descriptor is used.  Otherwise, the value specified with
@code{fread} overrides that of @code{fopen} and determines the data format.

The output argument @var{val} contains the data read from the file.

The optional return value @var{count} contains the number of elements read.

If the fourth argument @var{si} is provided, it is taken as the

If @var{si} is not supplied, the initial state vector is set to all

In terms of the Z Transform, @var{y} is the result of passing the

@deftypefnx {} {[i, j, v] =} find (@dots{})
Return a vector of indices of nonzero elements of a matrix, as a row if
@var{x} is a row vector or as a column otherwise.

To obtain a single index for each matrix element, Octave pretends that the
columns of a matrix form one long vector (like Fortran arrays are stored).
For example:

@example
@group
find (eye (2))
  @result{} [ 1; 4 ]
@end group
@end example

If two inputs are given, @var{n} indicates the maximum number of elements to
find from the beginning of the matrix or vector.

If three inputs are given, @var{direction} should be one of
@qcode{"first"} or @qcode{"last"}, requesting only the first or last
@var{n} indices, respectively.  However, the indices are always returned in
ascending order.

If two outputs are requested, @code{find} returns the row and column
indices of nonzero elements of a matrix.  For example:

@example
@group
[i, j] = find (2 * eye (2))
    @result{} i = [ 1; 2 ]
    @result{} j = [ 1; 2 ]
@end group
@end example

If three outputs are requested, @code{find} also returns a vector
containing the nonzero values.  For example:

@example
@group
[i, j, v] = find (3 * eye (2))
       @result{} i = [ 1; 2 ]
       @result{} j = [ 1; 2 ]
       @result{} v = [ 3; 3 ]
@end group
@end example

Note that this function is particularly useful for sparse matrices, as
it extracts the nonzero elements as vectors, which can then be used to
create the original matrix.  For example:

@example
@group
sz = size (a);
[i, j, v] = find (a);
b = sparse (i, j, v, sz(1), sz(2));

The standard notation is @math{P(a,x)}, e.g., @nospell{Abramowitz} and
@nospell{Stegun} (6.5.1).

If @var{a} is scalar, then @code{gammainc (@var{x}, @var{a})} is returned
for each element of @var{x} and vice versa.

If neither @var{x} nor @var{a} is scalar, the sizes of @var{x} and
@var{a} must agree, and @code{gammainc} is applied element-by-element.

By default the incomplete gamma function integrated from 0 to @var{x} is
computed.  If @qcode{"upper"} is given then the complementary function
integrated from @var{x} to infinity is calculated.  It should be noted that

Compute the greatest common divisor of @var{a1}, @var{a2}, @dots{}.

If more than one argument is given then all arguments must be the same size

integers.  Note that for Gaussian integers, the gcd is only unique up to a
phase factor (multiplication by 1, -1, i, or -i), so an arbitrary greatest
common divisor among the four possible is returned.

@deftypefnx {} {@var{all_value_list} =} set (@var{h})
Set named property values for the graphics handle (or vector of graphics
handles) @var{h}.

There are three ways to give the property names and values:

@itemize
@item as a comma separated list of @var{property}, @var{value} pairs

Here, each @var{property} is a string containing the property name, each
@var{value} is a value of the appropriate type for the property.

@item as a cell array of strings @var{properties} containing property names
and a cell array @var{values} containing property values.

In this case, the number of columns of @var{values} must match the number of
elements in @var{properties}.  The first column of @var{values} contains
values for the first entry in @var{properties}, etc.  The number of rows of
@var{values} must be 1 or match the number of elements of @var{h}.  In the
first case, each handle in @var{h} will be assigned the same values.  In the
latter case, the first handle in @var{h} will be assigned the values from
the first row of @var{values} and so on.

@item as a structure array @var{pv}

Here, the field names of @var{pv} represent the property names, and the
field values give the property values.  In contrast to the previous case,
all elements of @var{pv} will be set in all handles in @var{h} independent
of the dimensions of @var{pv}.
@end itemize

@code{set} is also used to query the list of values a named property will
take.  @code{@var{clist} = set (@var{h}, "property")} will return the list
of possible values for @qcode{"property"} in the cell list @var{clist}.
If no output variable is used then the list is formatted and printed to the
screen.

If no property is specified (@code{@var{slist} = set (@var{h})}) then a
structure @var{slist} is returned where the fieldnames are the properties of
the object @var{h} and the fields are the list of possible values for each
property.  If no output variable is used then the list is formatted and
printed to the screen.

For example,

@example
@group
hf = figure ();
set (hf, "paperorientation")
@result{}  paperorientation:  [ landscape | @{portrait@} | rotated ]
@end group
@end example

@noindent
shows the paperorientation property can take three values with the default
being @qcode{"portrait"}.

-*- texinfo -*-
@deftypefn {} {} addlistener (@var{h}, @var{prop}, @var{fcn})
Register @var{fcn} as listener for the property @var{prop} of the graphics
object @var{h}.

Property listeners are executed (in order of registration) when the property
is set.  The new value is already available when the listeners are executed.

@var{prop} must be a string naming a valid property in @var{h}.

@var{fcn} can be a function handle, a string or a cell array whose first
element is a function handle.  If @var{fcn} is a function handle, the
corresponding function should accept at least 2 arguments, that will be
set to the object handle and the empty matrix respectively.  If @var{fcn}
is a string, it must be any valid octave expression.  If @var{fcn} is a cell
array, the first element must be a function handle with the same signature
as described above.  The next elements of the cell array are passed
as additional arguments to the function.

Example:

@example
@group
function my_listener (h, dummy, p1)
  fprintf ("my_listener called with p1=%s\n", p1);
endfunction

addlistener (gcf, "position", @{@@my_listener, "my string"@})

@deftypefn  {} {} addproperty (@var{name}, @var{h}, @var{type})
@deftypefnx {} {} addproperty (@var{name}, @var{h}, @var{type}, @var{arg}, @dots{})
Create a new property named @var{name} in graphics object @var{h}.

@var{type} determines the type of the property to create.  @var{args}
usually contains the default value of the property, but additional
arguments might be given, depending on the type of the property.

The supported property types are:

@table @code
@item string
A string property.  @var{arg} contains the default string value.

@item any
An @nospell{un-typed} property.  This kind of property can hold any octave
value.  @var{args} contains the default value.

@item radio
A string property with a limited set of accepted values.  The first
argument must be a string with all accepted values separated by
a vertical bar ('|').  The default value can be marked by enclosing
it with a '@{' '@}' pair.  The default value may also be given as
an optional second string argument.

@item boolean
A boolean property.  This property type is equivalent to a radio
property with "on|off" as accepted values.  @var{arg} contains
the default property value.

@item double
A scalar double property.  @var{arg} contains the default value.

@item handle
A handle property.  This kind of property holds the handle of a
graphics object.  @var{arg} contains the default handle value.
When no default value is given, the property is initialized to
the empty matrix.

@item data
A data (matrix) property.  @var{arg} contains the default data
value.  When no default value is given, the data is initialized to
the empty matrix.

@item color
A color property.  @var{arg} contains the default color value.
When no default color is given, the property is set to black.
An optional second string argument may be given to specify an
additional set of accepted string values (like a radio property).
@end table

@var{type} may also be the concatenation of a core object type and
a valid property name for that object type.  The property created
then has the same characteristics as the referenced property (type,
possible values, hidden state@dots{}).  This allows one to clone an
existing property into the graphics object @var{h}.

Examples:

@example
@group
addproperty ("my_property", gcf, "string", "a string value");
addproperty ("my_radio", gcf, "radio", "val_1|val_2|@{val_3@}");
addproperty ("my_style", gcf, "linelinestyle", "--");

@deftypefnx {} {} waitfor (@var{h}, @var{prop}, @var{value})
@deftypefnx {} {} waitfor (@dots{}, "timeout", @var{timeout})
Suspend the execution of the current program until a condition is
satisfied on the graphics handle @var{h}.

While the program is suspended graphics events are still processed normally,
allowing callbacks to modify the state of graphics objects.  This function
is reentrant and can be called from a callback, while another @code{waitfor}
call is pending at the top-level.

In the first form, program execution is suspended until the graphics object
@var{h} is destroyed.  If the graphics handle is invalid, the function
returns immediately.

In the second form, execution is suspended until the graphics object is
destroyed or the property named @var{prop} is modified.  If the graphics
handle is invalid or the property does not exist, the function returns
immediately.

In the third form, execution is suspended until the graphics object is
destroyed or the property named @var{prop} is set to @var{value}.  The
function @code{isequal} is used to compare property values.  If the graphics
handle is invalid, the property does not exist or the property is already
set to @var{value}, the function returns immediately.

An optional timeout can be specified using the property @code{timeout}.
This timeout value is the number of seconds to wait for the condition to be
true.  @var{timeout} must be at least 1.  If a smaller value is specified, a
warning is issued and a value of 1 is used instead.  If the timeout value is
not an integer, it is truncated towards 0.

To define a condition on a property named @code{timeout}, use the string
@code{\timeout} instead.

In all cases, typing CTRL-C stops program execution immediately.

     @print{} ans = 900150983cd24fb0d6963f7d28e17f72
@end group

For the same string, the SHA-1 hash value is calculated with:

@example
@group
hash ("sha1", "abc")
     @print{} ans = a9993e364706816aba3e25717850c26c9cd0d89d

And to compute the hash value of a file, e.g., @code{file = "file.txt"},
call @code{hash} in combination with the @code{fileread}:

@example
@group
hash ("md5", fileread (file));

Typecast the 16 character hexadecimal character string to an IEEE 754
double precision number.

If fewer than 16 characters are given the strings are right padded with
@qcode{'0'} characters.

Given a string matrix, @code{hex2num} treats each row as a separate number.

The optional argument @var{class} can be passed as the string
@qcode{"single"} to specify that the given string should be interpreted as
a single precision number.  In this case, @var{s} should be an 8 character
hexadecimal string.  For example:

@example

@end example

@noindent
prints the prompt

@example

and waits for the user to enter a value.  The string entered by the user
is evaluated as an expression, so it may be a literal constant, a variable
name, or any other valid Octave code.

The number of return arguments, their size, and their class depend on the
expression entered.

If you are only interested in getting a literal string value, you can call
@code{input} with the character string @qcode{"s"} as the second argument.
This tells Octave to return the string entered by the user directly, without
evaluating it first.

Because there may be output waiting to be displayed by the pager, it is a
good idea to always call @code{fflush (stdout)} before calling @code{input}.
 This will ensure that all pending output is written to the screen before
your prompt.

The default value of the primary prompt string is @qcode{'octave:\#> '}.
To change it, use a command like

Load the named variables @var{v1}, @var{v2}, @dots{}, from the file
@var{file}.

If no variables are specified then all variables found in the
file will be loaded.  As with @code{save}, the list of variables to extract
can be full names or use a pattern syntax.  The format of the file is
automatically detected but may be overridden by supplying the appropriate
option.

If load is invoked using the functional form

@example
load ("-option1", @dots{}, "file", "v1", @dots{})
@end example

@noindent
then the @var{options}, @var{file}, and variable name arguments
(@var{v1}, @dots{}) must be specified as character strings.

If a variable that is not marked as global is loaded from a file when a
global symbol with the same name already exists, it is loaded in the
global symbol table.  Also, if a variable is marked as global in a file
and a local symbol exists, the local symbol is moved to the global
symbol table and given the value from the file.

If invoked with a single output argument, Octave returns data instead
of inserting variables in the symbol table.  If the data file contains
only numbers (TAB- or space-delimited columns), a matrix of values is
returned.  Otherwise, @code{load} returns a structure with members
 corresponding to the names of the variables in the file.

The @code{load} command can read data stored in Octave's text and
binary formats, and @sc{matlab}'s binary format.  If compiled with zlib
support, it can also load gzip-compressed files.  It will automatically
detect the type of file and do conversion from different floating point
formats (currently only IEEE big and little endian, though other formats
may be added in the future).

Valid options for @code{load} are listed in the following table.

@table @code
@item -force
This option is accepted for backward compatibility but is ignored.
Octave now overwrites variables currently in memory with
those of the same name found in the file.

@item -ascii
Force Octave to assume the file contains columns of numbers in text format
without any header or other information.  Data in the file will be loaded
as a single numeric matrix with the name of the variable derived from the
name of the file.

@item -binary
Force Octave to assume the file is in Octave's binary format.

@item -hdf5
Force Octave to assume the file is in @sc{hdf5} format.
(@sc{hdf5} is a free, portable binary format developed by the National
Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois.)
Note that Octave can read @sc{hdf5} files not created by itself, but may
skip some datasets in formats that it cannot support.  This format is
only available if Octave was built with a link to the @sc{hdf5} libraries.

@item -import
This option is accepted for backward compatibility but is ignored.
Octave can now support multi-dimensional HDF data and automatically
modifies variable names if they are invalid Octave identifiers.

@item  -mat

The special filename @samp{-} may be used to return the
content of the variables as a string.  If no variable names are listed,

The list of variables to save may use wildcard patterns containing
the following special characters:

@table @code
@item ?
Match any single character.

@item *
Match zero or more characters.

@item [ @var{list} ]
Match the list of characters specified by @var{list}.  If the first
character is @code{!} or @code{^}, match all characters except those
specified by @var{list}.  For example, the pattern @code{[a-zA-Z]} will
match all lower and uppercase alphabetic characters.

Wildcards may also be used in the field name specifications when using
the @option{-struct} modifier (but not in the struct name itself).

@end table

Except when using the @sc{matlab} binary data file format or the
@samp{-ascii} format, saving global
variables also saves the global status of the variable.  If the variable
is restored at a later time using @samp{load}, it will be restored as a
global variable.

The command

Lookup values in a sorted table.

This function is usually used as a prelude to interpolation.

If table is increasing and @code{idx = lookup (table, y)}, then
@code{table(idx(i)) <= y(i) < table(idx(i+1))} for all @code{y(i)} within
the table.  If @code{y(i) < table(1)} then @code{idx(i)} is 0.  If
@code{y(i) >= table(end)} or @code{isnan (y(i))} then @code{idx(i)} is
@code{n}.

If the table is decreasing, then the tests are reversed.
For non-strictly monotonic tables, empty intervals are always skipped.
The result is undefined if @var{table} is not monotonic, or if
@var{table} contains a NaN.

The complexity of the lookup is O(M*log(N)) where N is the size of
@var{table} and M is the size of @var{y}.  In the special case when @var{y}
is also sorted, the complexity is O(min(M*log(N),M+N)).

@var{table} and @var{y} can also be cell arrays of strings
(or @var{y} can be a single string).  In this case, string lookup
is performed using lexicographical comparison.

If @var{opts} is specified, it must be a string with letters indicating
additional options.

The second argument specifies the initial state of the system @math{x_0}.  The
third argument is a vector, @var{t}, specifying the time values for which a
solution is sought.

The fourth argument is optional, and may be used to specify a set of
times that the ODE solver should not integrate past.  It is useful for
avoiding difficulties with singularities and points where there is a
discontinuity in the derivative.

After a successful computation, the value of @var{istate} will be 2
(consistent with the Fortran version of @sc{lsode}).

If the computation is not successful, @var{istate} will be something
other than 2 and @var{msg} will contain additional information.

You can use the function @code{lsode_options} to set optional
parameters for @code{lsode}.

The matrix is not required to be square.

When called with two or three output arguments and a sparse input matrix,
@code{lu} does not attempt to perform sparsity preserving column
permutations.  Called with a fourth output argument, the sparsity
preserving column transformation @var{Q} is returned, such that
@code{@var{P} * @var{A} * @var{Q} = @var{L} * @var{U}}.

Called with a fifth output argument and a sparse input matrix,
@code{lu} attempts to use a scaling factor @var{R} on the input matrix
such that
@code{@var{P} * (@var{R} \ @var{A}) * @var{Q} = @var{L} * @var{U}}.
This typically leads to a sparser and more stable factorization.

An additional input argument @var{thres}, that defines the pivoting
threshold can be given.  @var{thres} can be a scalar, in which case
it defines the @sc{umfpack} pivoting tolerance for both symmetric and
unsymmetric cases.  If @var{thres} is a 2-element vector, then the first
element defines the pivoting tolerance for the unsymmetric @sc{umfpack}
pivoting strategy and the second for the symmetric strategy.  By default,
the values defined by @code{spparms} are used ([0.1, 0.001]).

Given the string argument @qcode{"vector"}, @code{lu} returns the values
of @var{P} and @var{Q} as vector values, such that for full matrix,
@code{@var{A}(@var{P},:) = @var{L} * @var{U}}, and @code{@var{R}(@var{P},:)
* @var{A}(:,@var{Q}) = @var{L} * @var{U}}.

With two output arguments, returns the permuted forms of the upper and
lower triangular matrices, such that @code{@var{A} = @var{L} * @var{U}}.
With one output argument @var{y}, then the matrix returned by the
@sc{lapack} routines is returned.  If the input matrix is sparse then the
matrix @var{L} is embedded into @var{U} to give a return value similar to
the full case.  For both full and sparse matrices, @code{lu} loses the
permutation information.

Given an LU@tie{}factorization of a real or complex matrix
@w{@var{A} = @var{L}*@var{U}}, @var{L}@tie{}lower unit trapezoidal and
@var{U}@tie{}upper trapezoidal, return the LU@tie{}factorization
of @w{@var{A} + @var{x}*@var{y}.'}, where @var{x} and @var{y} are
column vectors (rank-1 update) or matrices with equal number of columns
(rank-k update).

Optionally, row-pivoted updating can be used by supplying a row permutation
(pivoting) matrix @var{P}; in that case, an updated permutation matrix is
returned.  Note that if @var{L}, @var{U}, @var{P} is a pivoted
LU@tie{}factorization as obtained by @code{lu}:

@example
[@var{L}, @var{U}, @var{P}] = lu (@var{A});
@end example

@noindent
then a factorization of @tcode{@var{A}+@var{x}*@var{y}.'} can be obtained
either as

@example
[@var{L1}, @var{U1}] = lu (@var{L}, @var{U}, @var{P}*@var{x}, @var{y})
@end example

@noindent
or

@example
[@var{L1}, @var{U1}, @var{P1}] = lu (@var{L}, @var{U}, @var{P}, @var{x}, @var{y})
@end example

The first form uses the unpivoted algorithm, which is faster, but less
stable.  The second form uses a slower pivoted algorithm, which is more
stable.

The matrix case is done as a sequence of rank-1 updates; thus, for large
enough k, it will be both faster and more accurate to recompute the
factorization from scratch.

This is not the same as @code{x < 0.0}, because IEEE 754 floating point
allows zero to be signed.  The comparison @code{-0.0 < 0.0} is false,

Identify the matrix type or mark a matrix as a particular type.

This allows more rapid solutions of linear equations involving @var{A} to be
performed.

Called with a single argument, @code{matrix_type} returns the type of the
matrix and caches it for future use.

Called with more than one argument, @code{matrix_type} allows the type of
the matrix to be defined.

If the option @qcode{"nocompute"} is given, the function will not attempt
to guess the type if it is still unknown.  This is useful for debugging
purposes.

The possible matrix types depend on whether the matrix is full or sparse,
and can be one of the following

@table @asis
@item @qcode{"unknown"}
Remove any previously cached matrix type, and mark type as unknown.

@item @qcode{"full"}
Mark the matrix as full.

@item @qcode{"positive definite"}
Probable full positive definite matrix.

@item @qcode{"diagonal"}
Diagonal matrix.  (Sparse matrices only)

@item @qcode{"permuted diagonal"}
Permuted Diagonal matrix.  The permutation does not need to be specifically
indicated, as the structure of the matrix explicitly gives this.  (Sparse
matrices only)

@item @qcode{"upper"}
Upper triangular.  If the optional third argument @var{perm} is given, the
matrix is assumed to be a permuted upper triangular with the permutations
defined by the vector @var{perm}.

@item @qcode{"lower"}
Lower triangular.  If the optional third argument @var{perm} is given, the
matrix is assumed to be a permuted lower triangular with the permutations
defined by the vector @var{perm}.

@item  @qcode{"banded"}
@itemx @qcode{"banded positive definite"}
Banded matrix with the band size of @var{nl} below the diagonal and @var{nu}
above it.  If @var{nl} and @var{nu} are 1, then the matrix is tridiagonal
and treated with specialized code.  In addition the matrix can be marked as
probably a positive definite.  (Sparse matrices only)

@item @qcode{"singular"}
The matrix is assumed to be singular and will be treated with a minimum norm
solution.

@end table

Note that the matrix type will be discovered automatically on the first
attempt to solve a linear equation involving @var{A}.  Therefore
@code{matrix_type} is only useful to give Octave hints of the matrix type.
Incorrectly defining the matrix type will result in incorrect results from
solutions of linear equations; it is entirely @strong{the responsibility of
the user} to correctly identify the matrix type.

Also, the test for positive definiteness is a low-cost test for a Hermitian
matrix with a real positive diagonal.  This does not guarantee that the
matrix is positive definite, but only that it is a probable candidate.  When
such a matrix is factorized, a Cholesky@tie{}factorization is first
attempted, and if that fails the matrix is then treated with an
LU@tie{}factorization.  Once the matrix has been factorized,
@code{matrix_type} will return the correct classification of the matrix.

Find minimum values in the array @var{x}.

For a vector argument, return the minimum value.  For a matrix argument,
return a row vector with the minimum value of each column.  For a
multi-dimensional array, @code{min} operates along the first non-singleton
dimension.

If the optional third argument @var{dim} is present then operate along
this dimension.  In this case the second argument is ignored and should be
set to the empty matrix.

For two matrices (or a matrix and a scalar), return the pairwise minimum.

Thus,

@example
min (min (@var{x}))
@end example

@noindent
returns the smallest element of the 2-D matrix @var{x}, and

@example
@group

@end group

@noindent
compares each element of the range @code{2:5} with @code{pi}, and returns a
row vector of the minimum values.

For complex arguments, the magnitude of the elements are used for
comparison.  If the magnitudes are identical, then the results are ordered
by phase angle in the range (-pi, pi].  Hence,

@example
@group
min ([-1 i 1 -i])

Reset or specify the format of the output produced by @code{disp} and
Octave's normal echoing mechanism.

This command only affects the display of numbers but not how they are stored
or computed.  To change the internal representation from the default double
use one of the conversion functions such as @code{single}, @code{uint8},
@code{int64}, etc.

By default, Octave displays 5 significant digits in a human readable form
(option @samp{short} paired with @samp{loose} format for matrices).
If @code{format} is invoked without any options, this default format
is restored.

Valid formats for floating point numbers are listed in the following
table.

@table @code
@item short
Fixed point format with 5 significant figures in a field that is a maximum
of 10 characters wide.  (default).

If Octave is unable to format a matrix so that columns line up on the
decimal point and all numbers fit within the maximum field width then
it switches to an exponential @samp{e} format.

@item long
Fixed point format with 15 significant figures in a field that is a maximum
of 20 characters wide.

As with the @samp{short} format, Octave will switch to an exponential
@samp{e} format if it is unable to format a matrix properly using the
current format.

@item  short e
@itemx long e
Exponential format.  The number to be represented is split between a
mantissa and an exponent (power of 10).  The mantissa has 5 significant
digits in the short format and 15 digits in the long format.  For example,
with the @samp{short e} format, @code{pi} is displayed as
@code{3.1416e+00}.

@item  short E
@itemx long E
Identical to @samp{short e} or @samp{long e} but displays an uppercase
@samp{E} to indicate the exponent.
For example, with the @samp{long E} format, @code{pi} is displayed as
@code{3.14159265358979E+00}.

@item  short g
@itemx long g
Optimally choose between fixed point and exponential format based on
the magnitude of the number.
For example, with the @samp{short g} format,
@code{pi .^ [2; 4; 8; 16; 32]} is displayed as

@example
@group
ans =

      9.8696
      97.409
      9488.5
  9.0032e+07
  8.1058e+15
@end group
@end example

@item  short eng
@itemx long eng
Identical to @samp{short e} or @samp{long e} but displays the value
using an engineering format, where the exponent is divisible by 3.  For
example, with the @samp{short eng} format, @code{10 * pi} is displayed as
@code{31.4159e+00}.

@item  long G
@itemx short G
Identical to @samp{short g} or @samp{long g} but displays an uppercase
@samp{E} to indicate the exponent.

@item  free
@itemx none
Print output in free format, without trying to line up columns of
matrices on the decimal point.  This also causes complex numbers to be
formatted as numeric pairs like this @samp{(0.60419, 0.60709)} instead
of like this @samp{0.60419 + 0.60709i}.
@end table

The following formats affect all numeric output (floating point and
integer types).

@table @code
@item  "+"
@itemx "+" @var{chars}
@itemx plus
@itemx plus @var{chars}
Print a @samp{+} symbol for matrix elements greater than zero, a
@samp{-} symbol for elements less than zero and a space for zero matrix
elements.  This format can be very useful for examining the structure
of a large sparse matrix.

The optional argument @var{chars} specifies a list of 3 characters to use
for printing values greater than zero, less than zero and equal to zero.
For example, with the @samp{"+" "+-."} format,
@code{[1, 0, -1; -1, 0, 1]} is displayed as

@example
@group
ans =

+.-
-.+
@end group
@end example

@item bank
Print in a fixed format with two digits to the right of the decimal
point.

@item native-hex
Print the hexadecimal representation of numbers as they are stored in
memory.  For example, on a workstation which stores 8 byte real values
in IEEE format with the least significant byte first, the value of
@code{pi} when printed in @code{native-hex} format is
@code{400921fb54442d18}.

@item hex
The same as @code{native-hex}, but always print the most significant
byte first.

@item native-bit
Print the bit representation of numbers as stored in memory.
For example, the value of @code{pi} is

@example
@group
01000000000010010010000111111011
01010100010001000010110100011000
@end group
@end example

(shown here in two 32 bit sections for typesetting purposes) when
printed in native-bit format on a workstation which stores 8 byte real
values in IEEE format with the least significant byte first.

@item bit
The same as @code{native-bit}, but always print the most significant
bits first.

@item rat
Print a rational approximation, i.e., values are approximated
as the ratio of small integers.
For example, with the @samp{rat} format,
@code{pi} is displayed as @code{355/113}.
@end table

The following two options affect the display of all matrices.

@table @code
@item compact
Remove blank lines around column number labels and between
matrices producing more compact output with more data per page.

@item loose
Insert blank lines above and below column number labels and between matrices
to produce a more readable output with less data per page.  (default).

Compute the psi (polygamma) function.

The polygamma functions are the @var{k}th derivative of the logarithm
of the gamma function.  If unspecified, @var{k} defaults to zero.  A value
of zero computes the digamma function, a value of 1, the trigamma function,
and so on.

When computing the digamma function (when @var{k} equals zero), @var{z}
can have any value real or complex value.  However, for polygamma functions
(@var{k} higher than 0), @var{z} must be real and non-negative.

Numerically evaluate the integral of @var{f} from @var{a} to @var{b} using
Fortran routines from @w{@sc{quadpack}}.

@var{f} is a function handle, inline function, or a string containing the
name of the function to evaluate.  The function must have the form @code{y =
f (x)} where @var{y} and @var{x} are scalars.

@var{a} and @var{b} are the lower and upper limits of integration.  Either
or both may be infinite.

The optional argument @var{tol} is a vector that specifies the desired
accuracy of the result.  The first element of the vector is the desired
absolute tolerance, and the second element is the desired relative
tolerance.  To choose a relative test only, set the absolute
tolerance to zero.  To choose an absolute test only, set the relative
tolerance to zero.  Both tolerances default to @code{sqrt (eps)} or
approximately 1.5e-8.

The optional argument @var{sing} is a vector of values at which the
integrand is known to be singular.

The result of the integration is returned in @var{q}.

@var{ier} contains an integer error code (0 indicates a successful
integration).

@var{nfun} indicates the number of function evaluations that were
made.

@var{err} contains an estimate of the error in the solution.

The function @code{quad_options} can set other optional parameters for
@code{quad}.

Note: because @code{quad} is written in Fortran it cannot be called
recursively.  This prevents its use in integrating over more than one
variable by routines @code{dblquad} and @code{triplequad}.

Numerically evaluate the integral of @var{f} from @var{a} to @var{b}
using doubly-adaptive @nospell{Clenshaw-Curtis} quadrature.

@var{f} is a function handle, inline function, or string containing the name
of the function to evaluate.  The function @var{f} must be vectorized and
must return a vector of output values if given a vector of input values.
For example,

@example
f = @@(x) x .* sin (1./x) .* sqrt (abs (1 - x));
@end example

@noindent
which uses the element-by-element ``dot'' form for all operators.

@var{a} and @var{b} are the lower and upper limits of integration.  Either
or both limits may be infinite.  @code{quadcc} handles an inifinite limit
by substituting the variable of integration with @code{x = tan (pi/2*u)}.

The optional argument @var{tol} defines the relative tolerance used to stop
the integration procedure.  The default value is 1e-6.

The optional argument @var{sing} contains a list of points where the
integrand has known singularities, or discontinuities
in any of its derivatives, inside the integration interval.
For the example above, which has a discontinuity at x=1, the call to
@code{quadcc} would be as follows

@example
int = quadcc (f, a, b, 1.0e-6, [ 1 ]);
@end example

The result of the integration is returned in @var{q}.

@var{err} is an estimate of the absolute integration error.

@var{nr_points} is the number of points at which the integrand was
evaluated.

If the adaptive integration did not converge, the value of @var{err} will be
larger than the requested tolerance.  Therefore, it is recommended to verify
this value for difficult integrands.

@code{quadcc} is capable of dealing with non-numeric values of the integrand
such as @code{NaN} or @code{Inf}.  If the integral diverges, and
@code{quadcc} detects this, then a warning is issued and @code{Inf} or
@code{-Inf} is returned.

Note: @code{quadcc} is a general purpose quadrature algorithm and, as such,
may be less efficient for a smooth or otherwise well-behaved integrand than
other methods such as @code{quadgk}.

The algorithm uses @nospell{Clenshaw-Curtis} quadrature rules of increasing
degree in each interval and bisects the interval if either the function does
not appear to be smooth or a rule of maximum degree has been reached.  The
error estimate is computed from the L2-norm of the difference between two
successive interpolations of the integrand over the nodes of the respective
quadrature rules.

Return a matrix with random elements uniformly distributed on the
interval (0, 1).

The arguments are handled the same as the arguments for @code{eye}.

You can query the state of the random number generator using the form

@example
v = rand ("state")
@end example

This returns a column vector @var{v} of length 625.  Later, you can restore
the random number generator to the state @var{v} using the form

@example
rand ("state", v)
@end example

@noindent
You may also initialize the state vector from an arbitrary vector of length
@leq{} 625 for @var{v}.  This new state will be a hash based on the value of
@var{v}, not @var{v} itself.

By default, the generator is initialized from @code{/dev/urandom} if it is
available, otherwise from CPU time, wall clock time, and the current
fraction of a second.  Note that this differs from @sc{matlab}, which
always initializes the state to the same state at startup.  To obtain
behavior comparable to @sc{matlab}, initialize with a deterministic state
vector in Octave's startup files (@pxref{Startup Files}).

To compute the pseudo-random sequence, @code{rand} uses the Mersenne
Twister with a period of @math{2^{19937}-1}
(See @nospell{M. Matsumoto and T. Nishimura},
@cite{Mersenne Twister: A 623-dimensionally equidistributed uniform
pseudorandom number generator},
ACM Trans. on Modeling and Computer Simulation Vol. 8, No. 1, pp. 3--30,
January 1998,
@url{http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/emt.html}).
Do @strong{not} use for cryptography without securely hashing several
returned values together, otherwise the generator state can be learned after
reading 624 consecutive values.

Older versions of Octave used a different random number generator.
The new generator is used by default as it is significantly faster than the
old generator, and produces random numbers with a significantly longer cycle
time.  However, in some circumstances it might be desirable to obtain the
same random sequences as produced by the old generators.  To do this the
keyword @qcode{"seed"} is used to specify that the old generators should
be used, as in

@example
rand ("seed", val)
@end example

@noindent
which sets the seed of the generator to @var{val}.  The seed of the
generator can be queried with

@example
s = rand ("seed")
@end example

However, it should be noted that querying the seed will not cause
@code{rand} to use the old generators, only setting the seed will.  To cause
@code{rand} to once again use the new generators, the keyword
@qcode{"state"} should be used to reset the state of the @code{rand}.

The state or seed of the generator can be reset to a new random value using
the @qcode{"reset"} keyword.

The class of the value returned can be controlled by a trailing
@qcode{"double"} or @qcode{"single"} argument.  These are the only valid
classes.

Regular expression string matching.

Search for @var{pat} in @var{str} and return the positions and substrings of
any matches, or empty values if there are none.

The matched pattern @var{pat} can include any of the standard regex
operators, including:

@table @code

Match any character

@item * + ? @{@}
Repetition operators, representing

@table @code

Match @var{n} or more times

@item @{@var{m},@var{n}@}
Match between @var{m} and @var{n} times
@end table

@item [@dots{}] [^@dots{}]

List operators.  The pattern will match any character listed between
@qcode{"["} and @qcode{"]"}.  If the first character is @qcode{"^"} then the
pattern is inverted and any character except those listed between brackets
will match.

Escape sequences defined below can also be used inside list operators.  For
example, a template for a floating point number might be @code{[-+.\d]+}.

@item () (?:)
Grouping operator.  The first form, parentheses only, also creates a token.

@item |
Alternation operator.  Match one of a choice of regular expressions.  The
alternatives must be delimited by the grouping operator @code{()} above.

@item ^ $
Anchoring operators.  Requires pattern to occur at the start (@code{^}) or
end (@code{$}) of the string.

In addition, the following escaped characters have special meaning.

@table @code

@item \d
Match any digit

Implementation Note: For compatibility with @sc{matlab}, escape sequences
in @var{pat} (e.g., @qcode{"@xbackslashchar{}n"} => newline) are expanded
even when @var{pat} has been defined with single quotes.  To disable
expansion use a second backslash before the escape sequence (e.g.,
"@xbackslashchar{}@xbackslashchar{}n") or use the @code{regexptranslate}
function.

Alternatively, use (?x) in the pattern.

@item noemptymatch
Zero-length matches are not returned.  (default)

For example,

@example
@code{regexp (repmat ('a', 1, 1e5), '(a)+')}

The default for real matrices is a real Schur@tie{}decomposition.
A complex decomposition may be forced by passing the flag
@qcode{"complex"}.

The eigenvalues are optionally ordered along the diagonal according to the
value of @var{opt}.  @code{@var{opt} = "a"} indicates that all eigenvalues
with negative real parts should be moved to the leading block of @var{S}
(used in @code{are}), @code{@var{opt} = "d"} indicates that all
eigenvalues with magnitude less than one should be moved to the leading
block of @var{S} (used in @code{dare}), and @code{@var{opt} = "u"}, the

leading @var{k} columns of @var{U} always span the @var{A}-invariant
subspace corresponding to the @var{k} leading eigenvalues of @var{S}.

The Schur@tie{}decomposition is used to compute eigenvalues of a square
matrix, and has applications in the solution of algebraic Riccati equations

Create a sparse matrix from a full matrix, or row, column, value triplets.

If @var{a} is a full matrix, convert it to a sparse matrix representation,
removing all zero values in the process.

Given the integer index vectors @var{i} and @var{j}, and a 1-by-@code{nnz}
vector of real or complex values @var{sv}, construct the sparse matrix
@code{S(@var{i}(@var{k}),@var{j}(@var{k})) = @var{sv}(@var{k})} with overall
dimensions @var{m} and @var{n}.  If any of @var{sv}, @var{i} or @var{j} are
scalars, they are expanded to have a common size.

If @var{m} or @var{n} are not specified their values are derived from the
maximum index in the vectors @var{i} and @var{j} as given by
@code{@var{m} = max (@var{i})}, @code{@var{n} = max (@var{j})}.

@strong{Note}: if multiple values are specified with the same @var{i},
@var{j} indices, the corresponding value in @var{s} will be the sum of the
values at the repeated location.  See @code{accumarray} for an example of
how to produce different behavior, such as taking the minimum instead.

If the option @qcode{"unique"} is given, and more than one value is
specified at the same @var{i}, @var{j} indices, then the last specified
value will be used.

@code{sparse (@var{m}, @var{n})} will create an empty @var{m}x@var{n} sparse
matrix and is equivalent to @code{sparse ([], [], [], @var{m}, @var{n})}

The argument @code{nzmax} is ignored but accepted for compatibility with
@sc{matlab}.

Example 1 (sum at repeated indices):

@example
@group
@var{i} = [1 1 2]; @var{j} = [1 1 2]; @var{sv} = [3 4 5];
sparse (@var{i}, @var{j}, @var{sv}, 3, 4)

Create an @var{m}-by-@var{n} sparse matrix with pre-allocated space for at

This is useful for building a matrix incrementally by a sequence of indexed
assignments.  Subsequent indexed assignments after @code{spalloc} will reuse
the pre-allocated memory, provided they are of one of the simple forms

@itemize
@item @code{@var{s}(I:J) = @var{x}}

@item after the assignment, nnz (@var{S}) does not exceed @var{nz}.

Partial movement of data may still occur, but in general the assignment will
be more memory and time efficient under these circumstances.  In particular,

numbers and the complex unit is @qcode{'i'} or @qcode{'j'}:

@itemize
@item a + bi

@item a + b*i

@item a + i*b

@item bi + a

@item b*i + a

@item i*b + a
@end itemize

If present, a and/or b are of the form @nospell{[+-]d[,.]d[[eE][+-]d]} where
the brackets indicate optional arguments and @qcode{'d'} indicates zero or
more digits.  The special input values @code{Inf}, @code{NaN}, and @code{NA}
are also accepted.

@var{s} may be a character string, character matrix, or cell array.  For
character arrays the conversion is repeated for every row, and a double or
complex array is returned.  Empty rows in @var{s} are deleted and not
returned in the numeric array.  For cell arrays each character string
element is processed and a double or complex array of the same dimensions as
@var{s} is returned.

For unconvertible scalar or character string input @code{str2double} returns
a NaN@.  Similarly, for character array input @code{str2double} returns a
NaN for any row of @var{s} that could not be converted.  For a cell array,
@code{str2double} returns a NaN for any element of @var{s} for which
conversion fails.  Note that numeric elements in a mixed string/numeric
cell array are not strings and the conversion will fail for these elements
and return NaN.

risk of using @code{eval} on unknown data.

Convert subscripts to linear indices.

The input @var{dims} is a dimension vector where each element is the size of

@noindent
The left matrix contains the linear indices for each matrix element.  The right
matrix shows the subscript tuples for the same matrix.

The following example shows how to convert the two-dimensional indices
@code{(2,1)} and @code{(2,3)} of a 3-by-3 matrix to linear indices with a
single call to @code{sub2ind}.

The following example shows how to convert the linear indices @code{2} and
@code{8} in a 3-by-3 matrix into subscripts.

@example
@group
ind = [2, 8];
[r, c] = ind2sub ([3, 3], ind)
    @result{} r =  2   2
    @result{} c =  1   3
@end group
@end example

If the number of output subscripts exceeds the number of dimensions, the
exceeded dimensions are set to @code{1}.  On the other hand, if fewer
subscripts than dimensions are provided, the exceeding dimensions are merged
into the final requested dimension.  For clarity, consider the following
examples:

@example
@group
ind  = [2, 8];
dims = [3, 3];
## same as dims = [3, 3, 1]
[r, c, s] = ind2sub (dims, ind)
    @result{} r =  2   2
    @result{} c =  1   3
    @result{} s =  1   1
## same as dims = [9]
r = ind2sub (dims, ind)
    @result{} r =  2   8

If @var{system} is called with one or more output arguments, or if the
optional argument @var{return_output} is true and the subprocess is started
synchronously, then the output from the command is returned as a variable.
Otherwise, if the subprocess is executed synchronously, its output is sent

Return a new matrix formed by extracting the lower (@code{tril})
or upper (@code{triu}) triangular part of the matrix @var{A}, and
setting all other elements to zero.

The second argument is optional, and specifies how many diagonals above or
below the main diagonal should also be set to zero.

The default value of @var{k} is zero, so that @code{triu} and @code{tril}
normally include the main diagonal as part of the result.

If the value of @var{k} is nonzero integer, the selection of elements starts
at an offset of @var{k} diagonals above or below the main diagonal; above
for positive @var{k} and below for negative @var{k}.

The absolute value of @var{k} must not be greater than the number of
subdiagonals or superdiagonals.

For example:

@example
@group
tril (ones (3), -1)
     @result{}  0  0  0
         1  0  0
         1  1  0

@deftypefn {} {@var{y} =} typecast (@var{x}, "@var{class}")
Return a new array @var{y} resulting from interpreting the data of @var{x}
in memory as data of the numeric class @var{class}.

Both the class of @var{x} and @var{class} must be one of the built-in
numeric classes:

@example
@group
"logical"
"char"
"int8"
"int16"
"int32"

"uint8"
"uint16"
"uint32"
"uint64"
"double"
"single"
"double complex"
"single complex"
@end group
@end example

@noindent
the last two are only used with @var{class}; they indicate that a
complex-valued result is requested.  Complex arrays are stored in memory as
consecutive pairs of real numbers.  The sizes of integer types are given by
their bit counts.  Both logical and char are typically one byte wide;
however, this is not guaranteed by C++.  If your system is IEEE conformant,
single and double will be 4 bytes and 8 bytes wide, respectively.
@qcode{"logical"} is not allowed for @var{class}.

If the input is a row vector, the return value is a row vector, otherwise it
is a column vector.

If the bit length of @var{x} is not divisible by that of @var{class}, an
error occurs.

An example of the use of typecast on a little-endian machine is

@example
@group
@var{x} = uint16 ([1, 65535]);
typecast (@var{x}, "uint8")
@result{} [   1,   0, 255, 255]

@var{class} must be one of the built-in numeric classes:

@example

"int32"
"int64"

@end group
@end example

The number of elements of @var{x} should be divisible by the bit length of
@var{class}.  If it is not, excess bits are discarded.  Bits come in
increasing order of significance, i.e., @code{x(1)} is bit 0, @code{x(2)} is
bit 1, etc.

The result is a row vector if @var{x} is a row vector, otherwise it is a
column vector.

@deftypefn {} {} clear [options] pattern @dots{}
Delete the names matching the given patterns from the symbol table.

The pattern may contain the following special characters:

@table @code
@item ?
Match any single character.

@item *
Match zero or more characters.

@item [ @var{list} ]
Match the list of characters specified by @var{list}.  If the first
character is @code{!} or @code{^}, match all characters except those
specified by @var{list}.  For example, the pattern @samp{[a-zA-Z]} will
match all lowercase and uppercase alphabetic characters.
@end table

For example, the command

@example
clear foo b*r
@end example

@noindent
clears the name @code{foo} and all names that begin with the letter
@code{b} and end with the letter @code{r}.

If @code{clear} is called without any arguments, all user-defined
variables (local and global) are cleared from the symbol table.

If @code{clear} is called with at least one argument, only the visible
names matching the arguments are cleared.  For example, suppose you have
defined a function @code{foo}, and then hidden it by performing the
assignment @code{foo = 2}.  Executing the command @kbd{clear foo} once
will clear the variable definition and restore the definition of
@code{foo} as a function.  Executing @kbd{clear foo} a second time will
clear the function definition.

The following options are available in both long and short form

@table @code
@item -all, -a
Clear all local and global user-defined variables and all functions from the
symbol table.

@item -exclusive, -x
Clear the variables that don't match the following pattern.

@item -functions, -f
Clear the function names and the built-in symbols names.

@item -global, -g
Clear global symbol names.

@item -variables, -v
Clear local variable names.

@item -classes, -c
Clears the class structure table and clears all objects.

@item -regexp, -r
The arguments are treated as regular expressions as any variables that
match will be cleared.
@end table

With the exception of @code{exclusive}, all long options can be used
without the dash as well.

A full format string is:
@c Set example in small font to prevent overfull line

@smallexample
%[modifier]<command>[:width[:left-min[:balance]]];
@end smallexample

The following command sequences are available:

@table @code
@item %a
Prints attributes of variables (g=global, p=persistent, f=formal parameter,
a=automatic variable).

@item %b
Prints number of bytes occupied by variables.

@item %c
Prints class names of variables.

@item %e
Prints elements held by variables.

@item %n
Prints variable names.

@item %s
Prints dimensions of variables.

@item %t
Prints type names of variables.
@end table

Every command may also have an alignment modifier:

@table @code
@item l
Left alignment.

@item r
Right alignment (default).

@item c
Column-aligned (only applicable to command %s).
@end table

The @code{width} parameter is a positive integer specifying the minimum
number of columns used for printing.  No maximum is needed as the field will
auto-expand as required.

The parameters @code{left-min} and @code{balance} are only available when
the column-aligned modifier is used with the command @samp{%s}.
@code{balance} specifies the column number within the field width which
will be aligned between entries.  Numbering starts from 0 which indicates
the leftmost column.  @code{left-min} specifies the minimum field width to
the left of the specified balance column.

The default format is:

@qcode{"  %a:4; %ln:6; %cs:16:6:1;  %rb:12;  %lc:-1;@xbackslashchar{}n"}

When called from inside a function with the @qcode{"local"} option, the
variable is changed locally for the function and any subroutines it calls.

Define @var{function} to autoload from @var{file}.

The second argument, @var{file}, should be an absolute filename or a file
name in the same directory as the function or script from which the autoload
command was run.  @var{file} @emph{should not} depend on the Octave load
path.

Normally, calls to @code{autoload} appear in PKG_ADD script files that are
evaluated when a directory is added to Octave's load path.  To avoid having
to hardcode directory names in @var{file}, if @var{file} is in the same
directory as the PKG_ADD script then

@example
autoload ("foo", "bar.oct");
@end example

@noindent
will load the function @code{foo} from the file @code{bar.oct}.  The above
usage when @code{bar.oct} is not in the same directory, or usages such as

@example
autoload ("foo", file_in_loadpath ("bar.oct"))
@end example

@noindent
are strongly discouraged, as their behavior may be unpredictable.

With no arguments, return a structure containing the current autoload map.

If a third argument @qcode{"remove"} is given, the function is cleared and
not loaded anymore during the current Octave session.

@file{@var{file}.m} or to be on the execution path.

feval
@c feval libinterp/parse-tree/oct-parse.in.yy
-*- texinfo -*-
@deftypefn {} {} feval (@var{name}, @dots{})
Evaluate the function named @var{name}.

Any arguments after the first are passed as inputs to the named function.
For example,

@example
@group
feval ("acos", -1)
     @result{} 3.1416
@end group
@end example

@noindent
calls the function @code{acos} with the argument @samp{-1}.

The function @code{feval} can also be used with function handles of any sort
(@pxref{Function Handles}).  Historically, @code{feval} was the only way to
call user-supplied functions in strings, but function handles are now
preferred due to the cleaner syntax they offer.  For example,

@example
@group
@var{f} = @@exp;
feval (@var{f}, 1)
    @result{} 2.7183
@var{f} (1)
    @result{} 2.7183
@end group
@end example

@noindent
are equivalent ways to call the function referred to by @var{f}.  If it
cannot be predicted beforehand whether @var{f} is a function handle,
function name in a string, or inline function then @code{feval} can be used
instead.
@end deftypefn
builtin
@c builtin libinterp/parse-tree/oct-parse.in.yy
-*- texinfo -*-
@deftypefn {} {[@dots{}] =} builtin (@var{f}, @dots{})
Call the base function @var{f} even if @var{f} is overloaded to another
function for the given type signature.

This is normally useful when doing object-oriented programming and there is
a requirement to call one of Octave's base functions rather than the
overloaded one of a new class.

A trivial example which redefines the @code{sin} function to be the
@code{cos} function shows how @code{builtin} works.

@example
@group
sin (0)
  @result{} 0
function y = sin (x), y = cos (x); endfunction
sin (0)
  @result{} 1
builtin ("sin", 0)
  @result{} 0

eval
@c eval libinterp/parse-tree/oct-parse.in.yy
-*- texinfo -*-
@deftypefn  {} {} eval (@var{try})
@deftypefnx {} {} eval (@var{try}, @var{catch})
Parse the string @var{try} and evaluate it as if it were an Octave
program.

If execution fails, evaluate the optional string @var{catch}.

The string @var{try} is evaluated in the current context, so any results
remain available after @code{eval} returns.

The following example creates the variable @var{A} with the approximate
value of 3.1416 in the current workspace.

@example
eval ("A = acos(-1);");
@end example

If an error occurs during the evaluation of @var{try} then the @var{catch}
string is evaluated, as the following example shows:

@example
@group
eval ('error ("This is a bad example");',
      'printf ("This error occurred:\n%s\n", lasterr ());');
     @print{} This error occurred:
        This is a bad example
@end group
@end example

Programming Note: if you are only using @code{eval} as an error-capturing
mechanism, rather than for the execution of arbitrary code strings,
Consider using try/catch blocks or unwind_protect/unwind_protect_cleanup
blocks instead.  These techniques have higher performance and don't
introduce the security considerations that the evaluation of arbitrary code
does.

Parse and evaluate the string @var{try} as if it were an Octave program,
while capturing the output into the return variable @var{s}.

If execution fails, evaluate the optional string @var{catch}.

This function behaves like @code{eval}, but any output or warning messages
which would normally be written to the console are captured and returned in
the string @var{s}.

The @code{diary} is disabled during the execution of this function.  When
@code{system} is used, any output produced by external programs is
@emph{not} captured, unless their output is captured by the @code{system}
function itself.

@cindex Cholesky factorization
Compute the upper Cholesky@tie{}factor, @var{R}, of the real symmetric
or complex Hermitian positive definite matrix @var{A}.

The upper Cholesky@tie{}factor @var{R} is computed by using the upper
triangular part of matrix @var{A} and is defined by
@tex
$ R^T R = A $.
@end tex
@ifnottex

@example
@var{R}' * @var{R} = @var{A}.
@end example

@end ifnottex

Calling @code{chol} using the optional @qcode{"upper"} flag has the
same behavior.  In contrast, using the optional @qcode{"lower"} flag,
@code{chol} returns the lower triangular factorization, computed by using
the lower triangular part of matrix @var{A}, such that
@tex
$ L L^T = A $.
@end tex
@ifnottex

@example
@var{L} * @var{L}' = @var{A}.
@end example

@end ifnottex

Called with one output argument @code{chol} fails if matrix @var{A} is
not positive definite.  Note that if matrix @var{A} is not real symmetric
or complex Hermitian then the lower triangular part is considered to be
the (complex conjugate) transpose of the upper triangular part, or vice
versa, given the @qcode{"lower"} flag.

Called with two or more output arguments @var{p} flags whether the matrix
@var{A} was positive definite and @code{chol} does not fail.  A zero value
of @var{p} indicates that matrix @var{A} is positive definite and @var{R}
gives the factorization.  Otherwise, @var{p} will have a positive value.

If called with three output arguments matrix @var{A} must be sparse and
a sparsity preserving row/column permutation is applied to matrix @var{A}
prior to the factorization.  That is @var{R} is the factorization of
@code{@var{A}(@var{Q},@var{Q})} such that
@tex
$ R^T R = Q^T A Q$.
@end tex
@ifnottex

@example
@var{R}' * @var{R} = @var{Q}' * @var{A} * @var{Q}.
@end example

@end ifnottex

The sparsity preserving permutation is generally returned as a matrix.
However, given the optional flag @qcode{"vector"}, @var{Q} will be
returned as a vector such that
@tex
$ R^T R = A (Q, Q)$.
@end tex
@ifnottex

@example
@var{R}' * @var{R} = @var{A}(@var{Q}, @var{Q}).
@end example

@end ifnottex

In general the lower triangular factorization is significantly faster for
sparse matrices.

Compute the column approximate minimum degree permutation.

@code{@var{p} = colamd (@var{S})} returns the column approximate minimum
degree permutation vector for the sparse matrix @var{S}.  For a
non-symmetric matrix @var{S}, @code{@var{S}(:,@var{p})} tends to have
sparser LU@tie{}factors than @var{S}.  The Cholesky@tie{}factorization of
@code{@var{S}(:,@var{p})' * @var{S}(:,@var{p})} also tends to be sparser
than that of @code{@var{S}' * @var{S}}.

@var{knobs} is an optional one- to three-element input vector.  If @var{S}
is m-by-n, then rows with more than @code{max(16,@var{knobs}(1)*sqrt(n))}
entries are ignored.  Columns with more than
@code{max (16,@var{knobs}(2)*sqrt(min(m,n)))} entries are removed prior to
ordering, and ordered last in the output permutation @var{p}.  Only
completely dense rows or columns are removed if @code{@var{knobs}(1)} and
@code{@var{knobs}(2)} are < 0, respectively.  If @code{@var{knobs}(3)} is
nonzero, @var{stats} and @var{knobs} are printed.  The default is
@code{@var{knobs} = [10 10 0]}.  Note that @var{knobs} differs from earlier
versions of colamd.

@var{stats} is an optional 20-element output vector that provides data
about the ordering and the validity of the input matrix @var{S}.  Ordering
statistics are in @code{@var{stats}(1:3)}.  @code{@var{stats}(1)} and
@code{@var{stats}(2)} are the number of dense or empty rows and columns
ignored by @sc{colamd} and @code{@var{stats}(3)} is the number of garbage
collections performed on the internal data structure used by @sc{colamd}
(roughly of size @code{2.2 * nnz(@var{S}) + 4 * @var{m} + 7 * @var{n}}
integers).

Octave built-in functions are intended to generate valid sparse matrices,
with no duplicate entries, with ascending row indices of the nonzeros
in each column, with a non-negative number of entries in each column (!)
and so on.  If a matrix is invalid, then @sc{colamd} may or may not be able
to continue.  If there are duplicate entries (a row index appears two or
more times in the same column) or if the row indices in a column are out
of order, then @sc{colamd} can correct these errors by ignoring the
duplicate entries and sorting each column of its internal copy of the
matrix @var{S} (the input matrix @var{S} is not repaired, however).  If a
matrix is invalid in other ways then @sc{colamd} cannot continue, an error
message is printed, and no output arguments (@var{p} or @var{stats}) are
returned.
@sc{colamd} is thus a simple way to check a sparse matrix to see if it's
valid.

@code{@var{stats}(4:7)} provide information if @sc{colamd} was able to
continue.  The matrix is OK if @code{@var{stats}(4)} is zero, or 1 if
invalid.  @code{@var{stats}(5)} is the rightmost column index that is
unsorted or contains duplicate entries, or zero if no such column exists.
@code{@var{stats}(6)} is the last seen duplicate or out-of-order row
index in the column index given by @code{@var{stats}(5)}, or zero if no
such row index exists.  @code{@var{stats}(7)} is the number of duplicate
or out-of-order row indices.  @code{@var{stats}(8:20)} is always zero in
the current version of @sc{colamd} (reserved for future use).

The ordering is followed by a column elimination tree post-ordering.

Manage @sc{fftw} wisdom data.

Wisdom data can be used to significantly accelerate the calculation of the
FFTs, but implies an initial cost in its calculation.  When the @sc{fftw}
libraries are initialized, they read a system wide wisdom file (typically in
@file{/etc/fftw/wisdom}), allowing wisdom to be shared between applications
other than Octave.  Alternatively, the @code{fftw} function can be used to
import wisdom.  For example,

@example
@var{wisdom} = fftw ("dwisdom")
@end example

@noindent
will save the existing wisdom used by Octave to the string @var{wisdom}.
This string can then be saved to a file and restored using the @code{save}
and @code{load} commands respectively.  This existing wisdom can be
re-imported as follows

@example
fftw ("dwisdom", @var{wisdom})
@end example

If @var{wisdom} is an empty string, then the wisdom used is cleared.

During the calculation of Fourier transforms further wisdom is generated.
The fashion in which this wisdom is generated is also controlled by
the @code{fftw} function.  There are five different manners in which the
wisdom can be treated:

@table @asis
@item @qcode{"estimate"}
Specifies that no run-time measurement of the optimal means of
calculating a particular is performed, and a simple heuristic is used
to pick a (probably sub-optimal) plan.  The advantage of this method is
that there is little or no overhead in the generation of the plan, which
is appropriate for a Fourier transform that will be calculated once.

@item @qcode{"measure"}
In this case a range of algorithms to perform the transform is considered
and the best is selected based on their execution time.

@item @qcode{"patient"}
Similar to @qcode{"measure"}, but a wider range of algorithms is
considered.

@item @qcode{"exhaustive"}
Like @qcode{"measure"}, but all possible algorithms that may be used to
treat the transform are considered.

@item @qcode{"hybrid"}
As run-time measurement of the algorithm can be expensive, this is a
compromise where @qcode{"measure"} is used for transforms up to the size
of 8192 and beyond that the @qcode{"estimate"} method is used.
@end table

The default method is @qcode{"estimate"}.  The current method can
be queried with

@example
@var{method} = fftw ("planner")
@end example

@noindent
or set by using

@example
fftw ("planner", @var{method})
@end example

Note that calculated wisdom will be lost when restarting Octave.  However,
the wisdom data can be reloaded if it is saved to a file as described
above.  Saved wisdom files should not be used on different platforms since
they will not be efficient and the point of calculating the wisdom is lost.

The number of threads used for computing the plans and executing the
transforms can be set with

@example
fftw ("threads", @var{NTHREADS})
@end example

Note that octave must be compiled with multi-threaded @sc{fftw} support for
this feature.  The number of processors available to the current process is
used per default.

(Note: Unlike most commands, the single return value is not

If the matrix @var{A} is full, the permuted QR@tie{}factorization
@code{[@var{Q}, @var{R}, @var{P}] = qr (@var{A})} forms the
QR@tie{}factorization such that the diagonal entries of @var{R} are

@end example

The permuted @code{qr} factorization
@code{[@var{Q}, @var{R}, @var{P}] = qr (@var{A})} factorization allows the
construction of an orthogonal basis of @code{span (A)}.

If the matrix @var{A} is sparse, then the sparse QR@tie{}factorization
of @var{A} is computed using @sc{CSparse}.
As the matrix @var{Q} is in general a full matrix,
it is recommended to request only one return value,
which is the @var{Q}-less factorization @var{R} of @var{A}, such that
@code{@var{R} = chol (@var{A}' * @var{A})}.

If an additional matrix @var{B} is supplied and two return values are
requested, then @code{qr} returns
@var{C}, where @code{@var{C} = @var{Q}' * @var{B}}.  This allows the
least squares approximation of @code{@var{A} \ @var{B}} to be calculated
as

@example
@group
[@var{C}, @var{R}] = qr (@var{A}, @var{B})
x = @var{R} \ @var{C}

@end example

If the final argument is the scalar 0 and the number of rows is larger
than the number of columns, then an @qcode{"economy"} factorization is
returned, omitting zeroes of @var{R} and the corresponding columns of @var{Q}.
That is, @var{R} will have only @code{size (@var{A},1)} rows.  In this case,
@var{P} is a vector rather than a matrix.

If the final argument is the string @qcode{"vector"} then @var{P} is a
permutation vector instead of a permutation matrix.

Perform a symbolic factorization analysis of the sparse matrix @var{S}.

The input variables are

@table @var
@item S
@var{S} is a real or complex sparse matrix.

@item typ
Is the type of the factorization and can be one of

@table @asis
@item @qcode{"sym"} (default)
Factorize @var{S}.  Assumes @var{S} is symmetric and uses the upper
triangular portion of the matrix.

@item @qcode{"col"}
Factorize @tcode{@var{S}' * @var{S}}.

@item @qcode{"row"}
Factorize @tcode{@var{S} * @var{S}'}.

@item @qcode{"lo"}
Factorize @tcode{@var{S}'}.  Assumes @var{S} is symmetric and uses the lower
triangular portion of the matrix.
@end table

@item mode
When @var{mode} is unspecified return the Cholesky@tie{}factorization for
@var{R}.  If @var{mode} is @qcode{"lower"} or @qcode{"L"} then return
the conjugate transpose @tcode{@var{R}'} which is a lower triangular factor.
The conjugate transpose version is faster and uses less memory, but still
returns the same values for all other outputs: @var{count}, @var{h},
@var{parent}, and @var{post}.
@end table

The output variables are:

@table @var
@item count
The row counts of the Cholesky@tie{}factorization as determined by
@var{typ}.  The computational difficulty of performing the true
factorization using @code{chol} is @code{sum (@var{count} .^ 2)}.

@item h
The height of the elimination tree.

@item parent

Cholesky@tie{}factorization as determined by @var{typ}.

Return the symmetric reverse @nospell{Cuthill-McKee} permutation of @var{S}.

@var{p} is a permutation vector such that
@code{@var{S}(@var{p}, @var{p})} tends to have its diagonal elements closer
to the diagonal than @var{S}.  This is a good preordering for LU or
Cholesky@tie{}factorization of matrices that come from ``long, skinny''
problems.  It works for both symmetric and asymmetric @var{S}.

The algorithm represents a heuristic approach to the NP-complete bandwidth
minimization problem.  The implementation is based in the descriptions found
in

Symmetric Matrices}. Proceedings of the 24th ACM National Conference,

@deftypefn {} {} persistent @var{var}
Declare variables as persistent.

A variable that has been declared persistent within a function will retain its
contents in memory between subsequent calls to the same function.  The
difference between persistent variables and global variables is that persistent
variables are local in scope to a particular function and are not visible
elsewhere.

-*- texinfo -*-
@deftypefn {} {} try
Begin a try-catch block.

If an error occurs within a try block, then the catch code will be run and
execution will proceed after the catch block (though it is often recommended to
use the lasterr function to re-throw the error after cleanup is completed).

unwind_protect
@c libinterp/parse-tree/oct-parse.in.yy
-*- texinfo -*-
@deftypefn {} {} unwind_protect
Begin an unwind_protect block.

If an error occurs within the first part of an unwind_protect block the
commands within the unwind_protect_cleanup block are executed before the error
is thrown.  If an error is not thrown, then the unwind_protect_cleanup block is
still executed.  In other words, the unwind_protect_cleanup code is guaranteed
to execute regardless of success or failure in the unwind_protect block.
